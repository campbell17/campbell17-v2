Real romance is unromantic

The price of a romantic life is an endless list of unromantic responsibilities.

What do I mean? It doesn't take spontaneity, or surprises, or acts of woo. It's doing what you say you'll do when you say you'll do it. It's discussing and deciding who is doing what, down to the last detail. It's choosing which specific days of the week each person wakes up to tend to the children.



<!-- Notes: Talk about early days in the relationship when Kerri took charge of how things would work. This may be where it all falls apart since you don't want to tell everyone everything. Start here and see if you can make it work. You may have to bail. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
