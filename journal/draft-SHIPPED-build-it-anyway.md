It's just a shed.

We think it will take a week. It will take a month. We build it anyway.

We think it will cost half. It will cost double. We build it anyway.

We think it will be painless. We'll wake up sore every day. We build it anyway.

We make sure it's plumb. We check that it's level.

We fix some mistakes as we go. Others we leave. 

When the rain tries to stop us, we lay down the tarps.

When the wind tries to move us, we tie up our gear.

Some tools we buy. Others we borrow.

We save all the scrap, because you never know.

Now here stands something we built. We did our best in its making.

If we knew the duration, we wouldn't have started. We shouldn't spend the time.

If we knew the cost, we wouldn't have started. We shouldn't spend the money.

If we knew the stress, we wouldn't have started. We shouldn't spend the energy.

But we didn't know.

And with our ignorance, we brought something into this world. 

Something with purpose.

We discovered time, money, and effort otheriwse lost to entropy.

And we made the world just a little better.

Because in the end, it's never just a shed.



We uncovered the time we'd been saving for wasting. 

We discovered the money we'd been saving for squandering. 

We exposed the toughness we'd been saving for crises.


<!-- Notes: arrange "We built it anyway" so it's not all in the same place? Find some rhyming endings?  -->

<!-- The result of the above note: -->

Ignorance isn't always bliss. Sometimes it's mandatory.

This is about a shed. 

We build it anyway. 

We think it will take a couple weeks. It takes a couple months. We build it anyway.

We think it will cost half. It costs double. We build it anyway.

We think it will be painless. We wake up sore every day. We build it anyway.

We make sure it's plumb. We check that it's level.

We fix some mistakes as we go. Others we leave.

"It's just a shed." is the mantra we revel.

We set a firm foundation so the building won't heave.

When the rain tries to stop us, we lay tarps and keep at it.

When the wind tries to move us, we tie down and stand firm.

We save all the scrap, because you never know.

Some tools we buy. Some tools we borrow.




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
