Choosing the target

"Oh. I actually did it."

I don't know why I was surprised. By the age of twelve, I'd thrown so many objects I should have been able to knock a hummingbird out of the air with a pebble from twenty yards. Not that I'd want to. Yet, while winging a rock at the house across the street, I was astonished I'd actually shattered the window. The window on the bottom left. The exact window I was aiming for. The trajectory of my excitement mirror that of the rock. As it left my hand, I could tell it was on an accurate line. As it rose through the air, I could tell it had enough power to get there. But as it reached its apex and began the descent, my excitement became dread as potential and reality drew closer to each other. I froze in place after hearing the unmistakable sound of breaking glass, then did what kids do when trouble strikes. I fled the scene.

It's one thing to set out to cause mischief by breaking a window. There's already a name for that: Vandalism. But this was not that. My goal was not to do wrong, it was to test my accuracy. And I passed the test. So surely the next step was to run away in a panic. It was not. In fact, there was no next step. And this is the reason many good intentions meet an untoward end.

The next step.

Short-sightedness is an expected quality of immature brains. I was twelve when I thought it'd be cool to see if I could reach the house across the street with a rock. And my son was eleven yesterday when he thought it'd be acceptable to leave the house for school without a jacket on a 28º autumn morning. What's supposed to separate us from the animals (a.k.a. children) is the ability to project our mind a minimum of one step further into the future. Or, at the very least, the ability to gather the minimum viable criteria for a yes or no decision so it can crawl clumsily out of the "whim" category like a tetrapod leaving the ocean for dry land. So maybe I _am_ strong enough to reach the house across the street with this rock. What will my future look like if I hit it? And what _is_ the minimum temperature required for me to stand at the bus stop for 10 minutes in short sleeves without shivering so hard my shoelaces come untied? These are supposed to be the high-minded inquiries we visualize before we take action.

My hockey coach used to say, "Know where you've been, know where you are, and know where you're goin'." He was tough. He was scary. He was blue-collar. And he had false teeth that popped out if he screamed "fuck!" too loud. But he was wise. And while rationality is not an area at which humans are particularly skilled, that's exactly what he preached. He wanted us to make sure what we did made sense not just now, but in the next moment _and_ in retrospect. Good anticipation instincts are a byproduct of the practice of playing it forward in our minds. Ideally we go far enough to validate the decision, but not so far that it inhibits action. For example, I don't need to visualize my long, winding journey to age 88 on a gurney with debilitating plantar fasciitis before I can pull the trigger on these Asics trail runners. But I might want to consider taking the extra time to find a legal parking spot instead of risking getting towed. Because, "It's only for 5 minutes" risks turning into an entire day and hundreds in fees if it goes south.

The things we target are more important than our ability to hit them. We can always improve our accuracy, but it doesn't matter how dead your eye is if you always shoot the wrong guy.

Choose your targets wisely.




Don't just be accurate. Choose a worthy target.

As I recall this moment, a few things immediately come to mind in a desperate attempt to dull the spears of incredulity and exonerate myself from judgement. First, the house was still being built, so it was an unoccupied structure sitting on a lot of dirt, rocks, and construction supplies. Second, the window-seeking rock was the only one I threw, meaning I wasn't just standing there throwing rock after rock, hell-bent on breaking windows. Finally, and this may or may not be revisionist history, but if I remember correctly I was just seeing if I could reach the house. Yes, I aimed towards the window, but the house was so far away I didn't expect the rock to get there.



Regardless, though, I achieved my goal. My reward was writing "I will not throw rocks at houses any more" 100 times. 

Notes for next time: 
- Why was that my target? 
- I surprised myself by achieving my goal, but now what? 
- Oops, my goal was wrong. 
- The things we aim at are more important that whether or not we hit them. 
- There's a saying in golf, never punish yourself for a good shot. If I'm slicing the ball to the right all day, I might decide to aim into the left woods to account for that. But there's a chance I'll hit it straight - a "good shot" - and end up losing my ball. So instead of aiming into the woods, I aim just at the edge, so a good shot will end up safe instead of lost (holy fuck dude, BORING. Use it but make it suck less). 
- Also, maybe be less of a chicken shit with the second paragraph. Do people want to read you making excuses? Probably not. At the very least make it funnier.
- Maybe make the sentence writing punishment the ending?
- Maybe add some concrete examples of aiming going wrong vs. right?
- What happens when you don't aim at all?
- 



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
