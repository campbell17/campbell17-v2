from Roam: 
Perspective: Things are way harder than you think they are if you're actually considering doing them. Conversely, things are way easier than you think they are if you think doing them is impossible.

- There's something weird about how humans perceive the level of effort required to do things.
- Let's look at two tasks. It doesn't matter what they are for now. One of them seems difficult. I don't know anything about it. I don't know where to start. I don't even know who to talk to about getting started. This is impossible. The other task is a great idea. It sounds cool. It sounds fun. I still don't know anything about it, but it seems easy enough. How hard could it be?
- What's the difference?
- One is something way easier than I think it is. When I get into it, and especially when it's done, I'll kick myself for fretting so much and not starting it sooner.
- The other one is unbelievably difficult to execute. 
- Gotta think of powerful examples of both.
- Some examples
  - Starting a business
  - Buying a used miata and going racing with it
  - Starting a newsletter
  - 
- There are also some things that seem hard that are hard, but other people make them look easy. Like buying a house.

Notes for tomorrow: Examine what characteristics the scenarios have that make them sneaky hard or sneaky easy, despite being perceived as the opposite. Why would our minds deceive us like this?
