I have a secret. 

_A small part of my enjoyment of Formula One lies solely in its exclusivity._ Until recent years, the amount of exposure afforded to American fans was more limited and I had to make a conserted effort to procure decent coverage of just the races, let alone the additional reporting, analysis, and gossip associated with a major sport. But in my mind that effort was well worth it. I had dibs.

Though, does it really count as dibs if no one else wants it? My family didn't have any interest in motorsports, my friends thought I was nuts for waking up so early on Sundays, and my coworkers would tease me when I brought in VHS tapes[1] to replay races in the break room during lunch. "Who's gonna win this time, Tim?"

But the feeling of isolation from other fans comes with the guilty tradeoff of the idiotic human belief that I have the inside track on something special. And just to give you an idea of what I mean by isolation, here's the list of people I've ever talked to in person about F1 who watched at least one race:

* The owner of a video game store I used to go to when I was in college back in 2001
* My buddy Ian
* A guy on a cruise ship in 2018
* Three friends at work

That's the whole list.

This is 100% my fault. I'm a selfish fan. But this doesn't make any sense. It's irrational to avoid sharing something you love for fear others will also love it. That's ridiculous. It's like clinging to the hope that I'll always be able to say, "Oh, I liked it before it was popular.", like some dullard talking about music. 

What's more, I don't even act that way outwardly if I encounter another fan. That guy on the cruise ship? That's someone my wife works with. He had no idea the gravity of his mistake when he told me he liked Formula One. After 17 years of pent up excitement, opinions, and hot takes, I surprised even myself with how eager I was to fill his ears for fifteen minutes without taking a breath. I had to make a mental note that night to "Take it down a notch."

The disconnect between my love for the sport and how vocal I am to the uninitiated is curious. It's obvious I have a lot to say, but that only manifests when I'm talking to people who already share my enthusiasm. I want all the benefits of a well-established fanbase without doing my part to evangelize. But when I examine the possibility of joining communities of fans online, the root cause crystallizes immediately. I'm afraid of finding other people smarter and more passionate than I am about F1. If I'm the only one in the room who has any knowledge about something, I'm instantly promoted to the top of the hierarchy. But drop me instead in a packed room of F1 Redditors, and every turbo-nerd in the northern hemisphere is salivating at the prospect of schooling me on how wrong I am about Juan Pablo Montoya.

Ultimately, my biggest fear is a rise in popularity will somehow come with it a change in the fundamental nature of the sport. A change in the things that make it special to me. But this instinct is completely misguided. F1 is already popular. The "secret" is out. I can safely let go of my need to feel like I'm the only one who knows how incredible it is. And while I may not be able to entice my family to sit through an entire race, I can at least show them a taste of what their missing by putting Drive to Survive in their Netflix queue. 



<!-- the instinct isn't too far below the surface. Look at this SubStack, for God's sake. The subtext of its entire premise is "Yeah, I've been into watching this thing for 25 years...it's no big deal...I dunno, you might have heard of it...it's called FORMULA ONE."

Picture talking to a dullard about a band you like and their first response is "Oh, I liked them before they were popular." Fight it though I may, it's hard to shake the instinct to feel like I know something others don't.

Granted, I don't often initiate conversation with strangers, so my pool of potential race-buddies remains limited. And on the infrequent occasion I do meet someone new, announcing my passion for F1 isn't among the first few topics.  -->

- But the recent surge in visibility, helped along by the incredible Netflix series Drive to Survive, is the very thing I needed to transform my quiet passion for the sport into an active creative project. 
- And even though it's hard to shake the "I got here first" instinct, whenever I discover someone else likes F1, the excitement of having someone to talk to about it obliterates any desire to compare weiner sizes over who has more race watches under their belt.

NOTES: This could end here, but it'd be pretty damn short. What else can I say: Talk about all the pent up opinions, ideas, talking points, and other unconcious views you've been holding on to and how they always just spill out when you talk to someone new. Remember that guy on the cruise ship? That was someone my wife worked with. He had no idea what he was in for (this is all horrible grammar, plz fix) when he intimated to me he was an F1 fan. Being the first person I talked to in 17 years, I was equally unprepared for my outburst. I made a mental note to myself that night: "Take it down a notch."

Also, there's still a part of you that wishes you were the only one who knew. When I see ads for the US GP, I wish I didn't. Shhh! Don't tell, then all the riff raff will get in. But I know this is counter productive.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
