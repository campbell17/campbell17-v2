I used to live in an apartment. Across from the couch sat the HUGE 32" Panasonic television. Sitting to the right, my HUGE 19" CRT monitor. 90's beige. I did all my work on that beige monstrosity. And by work, I mean fumbling meandering. This apartment was the last place I lived before my career in design began. And that little workstation acted as an unread notification every time I sat on the couch to watch TV or play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

For next time: Talk about how the computer was a constant source of pressure to do the responsible thing. Maybe talk about the bus rides with your sketchbook and mp3 player. Find the model and show the pic. Or was it your Aiwa discman? Show both.
