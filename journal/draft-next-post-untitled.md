I used to live in an apartment. Across from the couch sat the HUGE (TVs were smaller back then) 32" Panasonic television. Sitting to the right, my HUGE (monitors were smaller back then) 19" CRT monitor. 90's beige. Bigger front to back than side to side. I did all my work on that monstrosity. And by work, I mean fumbling meandering. This apartment was the last place I lived before I started my design career, and the path to getting a foot in the door was via Windows XP and my crusty computer. That little workstation acted as an unread notification every time I sat on the couch to watch TV or play my brand new copy of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It was the opposite of "out of sight, out of mind", since I had to hide behind the shower curtain with the bathroom door shut to avoid locking eyes with it from across the room.

At the time I was figuring out what I wanted my adult life to look like. The ink finally dried on my diploma and even though I was working full time, it wasn't related to my field of study. I knew I wanted a creative career, but that's where the certainty petered out. "How does one land a career in the arts?", I thought to myself, coming to grips with the fact that they kind of glossed over the details of that stuff in art school. One thing I did learn is having a portfolio is a good start, so once I made the committment to pursue a creative career path, that was the goal. 

Now, unless you're an aggresive over achiever in school, you have to start from scratch on your portfolio after you graduate.




For next time: (This still applies) Talk about how the computer was a constant source of pressure to do the responsible thing. Maybe talk about the bus rides with your sketchbook and mp3 player. Find the model and show the pic. Or was it your Aiwa discman? Show both.
