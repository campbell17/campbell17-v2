I used to live in an apartment. Across from the couch sat the HUGE (TVs were smaller back then) 32" Panasonic television. Sitting to the right, my HUGE (monitors were smaller back then) 19" CRT monitor. 90's beige. Bigger front to back than side to side. I did all my work on that monstrosity. And by work, I mean fumbling meandering. This apartment was the last place I lived before I started my design career, and the path to getting a foot in the door was via Windows XP and my crusty computer. That little workstation acted as an unread notification every time I sat on the couch to watch TV or play my brand new copy of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It was the opposite of "out of sight, out of mind", since I had to hide behind the shower curtain with the bathroom door shut to avoid locking eyes with it from across the room.

At the time I was figuring out what I wanted my adult life to look like. The ink on my diploma was already fading and even though I was working full time, it wasn't related to my field of study. I knew I wanted a creative career, but that's where the certainty petered out. "How does one land a career in the arts?", I thought to myself, coming to grips with the fact that they kind of glossed over the details of that stuff in art school. One thing I did learn is having a portfolio is a good start, so once I committed to continue pursuing a creative career path, that was the goal. 

My portfolio coming out of school was passable, but it was all photography work. This makes sense. My degree is in photography. But I wanted a career making stuff like this: (show pic of ATHF DVD packaging with the caption of something like, "Meatwad get the honeys, G.")

This presented a small issue. Just a little nuisance, really. I had zero things in my portfolio that matched the kind work I wanted to do. The creative fields aren't like the average job. You don't draft a resum√© detailing your skills and experience and have the hiring manager skim it as they daintily dip the bottom edge into the gaping maw of the paper shredder. By contrast, art directors have only one way to evaluate if the work you produce will match the job they're hiring for: by looking at work you've actually done already. When looking for your _first gig_, this is very chicken-and-egg. 

(blockquote) "How do I...I haven't done any professional work yet...but you need to see what work I've done...I need to lay down.

This is utterly absurd but it comes with a tremendous silver lining. Since the most important thing is the work in my portfolio, I can (and should) fill it with the exact type of work I want to do. Yes, my degree is in photography, but if my portfolio is full of incredible packaging design or logos or comic book illustration, that's the kind of work I'll be hired to do. Imagine that concept in other fields. Imagine getting your degree in English literature and as you're stepping off the curb outside the school to embark on your exciting new life, you rub your hands together and think, "Right...let's go start my career in marine biology".

In reality, this happens all the time. How many people do you know whose career matches up neatly with what they studied in college? Well, if you're still in school I guess the number is zero, but it won't grow much higher as you get older. The difference in the creative fields is the ability to show your skill up front before the hiring. And if you have skill, persistence, and you're not a terror to work with, you'll get the work.

The first order of business was to make a list of fake assignments. Each assignment would have a shallow design brief with some prompts to get me started and the finished product would end up in my portfolio. Making the list was fun.

For next time: Talk about the assignment list being the easy part and then the reality of no deadlines leading to easy procrastination, then this stuff: (This still still applies) Talk about how the computer was a constant source of pressure to do the responsible thing. Maybe talk about the bus rides with your sketchbook and mp3 player. Find the model and show the pic. Or was it your Aiwa discman? Show both.
