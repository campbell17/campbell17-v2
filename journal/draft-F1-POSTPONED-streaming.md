<!-- I'm abandoning this essay. Two weeks in a row it's pulling teeth and I don't believe in the idea. -->

It was so much harder before streaming.

Being obsessed with a European sport in America before the dawn of streaming services meant I had to be vigilant. For the first few years I settled for tape-delayed coverage I had blank VHS tapes atop the VCR at my parents house in the event I coulnd't make the drive home from college on race weekends. 

- I want through all this trouble to make sure I didn't mess up a recording because I knew there was no second chance.
- Remember VHS? Probably not if you're under 40. I had to have blank tapes on standby at my parent's house so they could tape the races while I was at college.
- It got a little easier with DVR, but god forbid anything happened to the listing or the HD ran low.
- The only race I know I missed for certain was the 2000 German Grand Prix at the old Hockenheim. I was in Ireland with my family and someone mentioned Rubens Barrichello got his first win. Race spoiled. I can't remember if I set that one up to record, but either way I had to wait some time before I got to see him crying on the podium.
- 

- By the end of this piece I need to be diving out of the way of internet exposure so I don't spoil the rare delayed watch AND don't get so burned out I need to take a break.

But now I face another problem. A different problem. 

How I avoid burnout.

There is such a thing as too much of a good...ok, thing. 


The end: It was so much easier before streaming.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
