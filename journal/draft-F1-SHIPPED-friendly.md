F1 is the friendliest it's ever been.

I like when everyone gets along. There's thrill in conflict, sure, but I can never shake my deep desire for everything to be copasetic. And when two people are at odds, the romantic part of me is on the edge of his seat waiting for them to come to a mutual understanding, give each other a knowing nod from across the room, and resolve their differences with a Hollywood-style "you can be my wing-man any day" one-liner. In the two and a half decades I've been following the sport, Formula One hasn't exactly fit this mold. This makes sense when you consider what's at stake. Unlike other sports where disagreements in the field of play usually result in nothing more than an argument, motor racing clashes can have life and death consequences. But with the increases in safety and a new crop of young drivers who've been racing against each other since childhood, the vibe in the paddock is getting a lot more chummy.

In recent decades, the closest thing to a public friendship in F1 was between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in the early 2010s. The media put time into reminding everyone how close they were in their karting days, followed by a predictable editorial casting that closeness into doubt amidst the pressures of their intra-team championship battle. It's difficult to decipher how much of their "friendship" was fabricated journalistic fodder, but that championship pressure was real. And as the heat increased on their rivalry, the temperature plummeted on their friendship.

But prowling in the background of the drama playing out at Mercedes was a new kind of personality. He arrived in F1 two seasons before their Mercedes duel began, and he carried something seldom seen in this, the ultra-serious pinnacle of motorsport: a permanent smile.

Australian Daniel Ricciardo's gregarious nature and playful attitude contradicted the predominant demeanor possessed by the rest of the grid. And with his skill on track, it was clear he and his antics were sticking around. On track, like all F1 drivers, he was a killer. But it was his off-track personality that set him apart and added a levity the sport didn't even know it needed. But with 19 other drivers, it was hard to make a dent in the status quo. In an ever evolving sport, however, another change was on the horizon.

Between the 2015 and 2019 seasons, a flood of new talent washed over Formula One, giving Ricciardo ample opportunity to spread his infectious positivity to the next generation of drivers. This, coupled with a rejuvenated social media presence after an ownership change in 2017, culminated in the 2019 season with the arrival of a close-knit trio of friends: George Russell, Alex Albon, and Lando Norris.

George, Alex, and Lando all beamed with youthful exuberance like three best friends getting on the school bus. They teased each other in interviews, often smack-talking each other's performance on track, something no one would dream of doing in years past. Ricciardo finally had some playmates. In one press conference, Daniel quietly asked Lando, who's prone to laughing fits, "have you grown pubes yet?", a less-than-subtle commentary on the remarkable youth of Norris:

But for all the influence Daniel and the youth of F1 have on its growing amicability, there's another deeper factor at play. Without the increased levels of safety of modern cars and tracks, none of these changes in attitude are possible. The specter of mortality will always loom over motorsport, but it's not something permeating the paddock as it did in the old days. From its inception in 1950 all the way through the mid-nineties, it was never a question of _if_ but _when_ the next fatality would occur. Since then, however, the strides made in the name of safety mean only in unbelievably extenuating circumstances should anyone have to give their life for the sport we all love. The people working tirelessly to introduce more safety measures translates to the teams and drivers being able to breathe more easily and allow humor to have a seat at the table.

It's also worth mentioning that once a championship trophy is on the line, there's no guarantee the smiles will stay. One constant amongst all the ribbing and cackling is the driver's title going to either Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen. I'm hoping with fingers and toes crossed that the bond between this new crop of drivers is so strong, they wouldn't allow a championship fight to permanently damage their friendship. But humans act in sometimes unfortunate ways when the pressure is on and the stakes are at their highest, so we'll only know when we see it play out.

One of my favorite things about F1 is always finding new things to love about it. The unbridled intensity with which I'm most familiar is now tempered with a cross-team, paddock-wide camaraderie I'm all too willing to embrace. Daniel Ricciardo came along at the perfect time - a time when the most public friendship in the paddock was dissolving before our eyes - and bridged the gap between the stone-faced tension of yesterday and the easy-going buoyancy of today. I'm glad he has a drive for next season. Hopefully he and the youth of F1 will be around for a while, teaching the incoming progeny how to do it all with a smile.


- They say familiarity breeds contempt, but I think familiarity in this case is precisely responsible for the camaraderie amongst the kids on track.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
