Losing control of our emotions while driving is one of the dumbest things we do as a species. We're cocooned in a coffin of glass, plastic, leather, and steel, rumbling ahead at speeds god didn't intend, and at a time when our judgement should be at its sharpest, we often allow emotion to yank us out of the drivers seat and fully take the helm. And sometimes we don't just allow it, we rapaciously seek it out. Have you ever been in the car with someone who has something shitty to say about every other car on the road? Their preoccupation with everything outside of their control leaves little cognitive room to deal with the job of piloting their vessel properly. As I get older, the concept of caring about other drivers' behavior gets increasingly foreign. Which is an improvement, considering I was one of the worst transgressors of emotional driving for more than a decade.

I once rear-ended someone at a stop light because I got right up his ass after he cut me off. It wasn't even a conscious decision. Getting right up people's asses was just what I did. When he got out of his car to check his bumper, I held my hands out, palms up, as if it was his fault. I stayed in my car which was the only redeeming decision of the transaction, since further escalation was highly probable if I got out. I was convinced he caused the whole incident. Such was the depth of my delusion.

Years before, when I was still in high school, I followed someone home after they yelled "moron!" while passing me as I waited to turn into a gas station. I needed gas. Hence the waiting. But I didn't need gas so desperately that I couldn't turn off my blinker, get right up this guy's ass, and tail him all the way to his house, stopping at the end of his driveway to glare as he pulled into the garage. And oh, by the way, he had kids in the car with him. These are the actions of an unhinged psychopath.

And my driving fury wasn't only triggered by people outside the car. I was once leaving a convenience store with a girlfriend and we got into an argument. I don't recall what it was about, but at some point I felt compelled to aggressively wrench the steering wheel to induce a sudden U-turn and head back to the store. When I looked over, my girlfriend had completely squished the donut she was eating because her fist involuntarily clenched in terror when I rage-turned. Rear-ending someone is one thing, but ruining a perfectly good vanilla frosted donut is where I drew the line. I obviously had a problem.

And if I wasn't raging at other cars or people daintily holding food, I was probably speeding. Speeding goes hand in hand with unbridled emotional driving because the part of your brain responsible for rationality (small though it may be) takes a smoke break during both activities. But while emotional driving gets you in trouble with your fellow commuters, speeding usually involves police. I enjoyed speeding in my youth and got pulled over a few times, but it wasn't too egregious. Until one day I wanted to drag race away from a stoplight. Oh there was no other car, I was just being a fucking idiot. By the time I saw the lights in my rearview mirror, he had me going 89 in a 45. This one was new territory. "What possible explanation do you have for going that fast?", posed the officer. I could only muster one word, posed meekly as a question: "Immaturity?" He wryly acknowledged my succinct honesty and got back in the squad car to write up the citation.

I'd never been to court before. Many speeders were in attendance, as I came to realize this must be an epidemic of sorts.

Notes: transition into speeding, then the ticket, then the changeEvent, and so on

- Story about being in the car with someone who was preoccupied with all the other drivers
- This is completely foreign to me now, and seeing a grown ass adult get angry at other cars is gross
- But that wasn't always the case
- Story about rear ending the guy at the stoplight next to the penitentary
- Story about following the guy home in Basking Ridge (redact the town)
- Story about pulling the u-ey and my ex girlfriend squishing her donut as a result? Not as relevant, but funny.
- Story about getting cutoff on the way back from the airport recently and feeling nothing - this will be part of the juxtaposition between old vs. new ways of dealing with the same events
- What's the difference? When did I change?
- In conjunction with my rage, I was also reckless. A speeder.
- This used to be simple single guy shit. (as I write these stories out, seems eh' s'deeper)
But...
- Then I had kids. A wife. A family.
Therefore...
- I had to cut that shit out. 
But I liked to speed...
Therefore I continued speeding.
But I got caught. 89 in a 45.
Therefore...
The cop asked me what possible explanation I could have for going that fast.
I gave him a single word, posed as a question: "immaturity?"
He wryly aknowledged my honesty.
But gave me a big ass ticket
Therefore...
I found myself in court.
All us vagrants stood in line awaiting judgement. I was feeling pretty foolish about my 89 in a 45 until the guy in front of me went. He was doing 100+ when he got caught.
I felt relieved, but I still had to face the man.
THe judge was pleasant - he reminded me of Alan Alda.
But his job was to keep me from doing this again.
Therefore, 
what better way than offering the 8 hour court-appointed online driving course to avoid getting points on my license.
- Short explainer of how that works for anyone unfamiliar.
- I was already familiar.
- Go over the section responsible for changing my perspective on emotional driving.
- It was like a light bulb went on. I don't have to be any certain way toward the other drivers. 
- Just Move Over. This was the mantra.
- Getting less agitated wasn't the only thing that happened.
- I stopped speeding.
- In the 15 years since
- Thinking other drivers are even thinking about you is self-centered and egotistical.

Notes for next time: Write it out.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
