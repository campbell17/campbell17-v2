- Story about being in the car with someone who was preoccupied with all the other drivers
- This is completely foreign to me now, and seeing a grown ass adult get angry at other cars is gross
- But that wasn't always the case
- Story about rear ending the guy at the stoplight next to the penitentary
- Story about following the guy home in Basking Ridge (redact the town)
- Story about pulling the u-ey and my ex girlfriend squishing her donut as a result? Not as relevant, but funny.
- Story about getting cutoff on the way back from the airport recently and feeling nothing - this will be part of the juxtaposition between old vs. new ways of dealing with the same events
- What's the difference? When did I change?
- In conjunction with my rage, I was also reckless. A speeder.
- This used to be simple single guy shit.
But...
- Then I had kids. A wife. A family.
Therefore...
- I had to cut that shit out. 
But I liked to speed...
Therefore I continued speeding.
But I got caught. an 89 in a 45.
Therefore...
The cop asked me what possible explanation I could have for going that fast.
I gave him a single word, posed as a question: "immaturity?"
He wryly aknowledged my honesty.
But gave me a big ass ticket
Therefore...
I found myself in court.
All us vagrants stood in line awaiting judgement. I was feeling pretty foolish about my 89 in a 45 until the guy in front of me went. He was doing 100+ when he got caught.
I felt relieved, but I still had to face the man.
THe judge was pleasant - he reminded me of Alan Alda.
But his job was to keep me from doing this again.
Therefore, 
what better way than offering the 8 hour court-appointed online driving course to avoid getting points on my license.
- Short explainer of how that works for anyone unfamiliar.
- Go over the section responsible for changing my perspective on emotional driving.
- It was like a light bulb went on. I don't have to be any certain way toward the other drivers. 
- Just Move Over. This was the mantra.

Notes for next time: continue outline until the surprise is revealed and you have clear direction on the ending. Look over the previous essay for the structure notes.
