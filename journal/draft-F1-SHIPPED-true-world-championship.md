First it was five years of German and Italian. Then, two years of Spanish and French. After that, four years of German and Austrian. Then a long period of British and German before settling in to three years and counting of Dutch and Austrian. I had no idea being an F1 fan meant humming along to novel pairs of national anthems on a bi-weekly basis. 

In America, we have a habit of naming the winners of our sports World Champions. When the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and National Basketball Association hang championship banners in their stadiums, they all have "World Champions" ebmlazoned above the year. Out of the four major national sports, only the National Hockey League bucks this trend by allowing the name of its legendary trophy to take center stage, crowning each winner "Stanley Cup Champions". Ironically, the NHL is the only major sport where we occasionally hear a national anthem _other_ than the United States when one of the seven Canadian teams get to hear "O Canada" belted out before the game. 

But unlike sports in America, the Formula One World Championship backs up its namesake with true worldwide participation. Since the sport began in 1950, race winners from 23 different nations were blessed with the honor of hearing their country's national anthem as they soaked in the moment from the top step of the podium. And since 1958 when the constructor's championship was introduced, the anthem for the winning team plays immediately following the driver's anthem. Couple that with the propensity for [periods of dominance by one driver], and I start unconsciously humming the first few notes of the constructor's anthem before it start because I'm so used to hearing the two together. To this day, I can't hear the final three notes of the German national anthem without immediately wanting to burst into humming Il Canto degli Italiani. Thanks for that, Schuey.

But hearing the anthems after every race adds something to the experience of following F1. It's a magnetic intangible that makes me feel less isolated. Seeing people from all over the world come together toward a common goal, superfluous as racing may seem, makes me feel less at odds with the unfamiliar. It reminds me of travel. When we travel, we put aside our familiar comforts, routines, and habits in the service of expanding our experiences. We expose ourselves voluntarily to the unknown and we come back with a newfound appreciation for ways of life that don't precisely mirror our own.

The national anthems I hear at the end of every race are not from my country. I'll be elated I ever get to hear the Star-Spangled Banner on a Formula One podium, but maybe it's good I've had to wait. Because every time I hear another unfamiliar anthem, it makes me feel more and more a part of the rest of the world.



- It's like my favorite spotify playlist, I expect to hear the first note of the constructor following the last note of the driver



- 2 championships since 1958


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
