How to Apply
Please submit an application that speaks directly to this position. Tell us about yourself, about what you can bring to 37signals, and why this position is the right next step for you. Tell us why you're a designer. Tell us why you love working on the web. Be descriptive, but don’t feel the need to write a novel — 800 words or so should be plenty. Last, be sure to show us your work, and work other people have done that you really admire.




My Story
Fourteen years and seven months ago, I joined Spatial Networks* as their 12th employee and first design hire. They needed...everything. My title was UI Designer, but I did it all, online and in print. But we'll come back to that.

Before that, I founded a design agency called Whiteshark Creations with a colleague, though I realized agency life wasn't my calling and I signed over my portion the business soon after.

Prior to going solo, my design career began its infancy, when Macromedia was still a household name and Web 2.0 was hitting it's bubbly prime. I started as a web designer and this is where I first clapped eyes on naked HTML & CSS - No WYSIWYG editor to hide all the crimes. We had dedicated developers to write all the code, so my exposure and practice only came in fits and starts. I wouldn't feel the power of `git push origin master` until my first year working at Spatial Networks.

When you're the only designer for the rabid firehose of ideas we called a CEO, becoming a generalist is a matter of survival. I have sketchbooks with pages chock full of logos, mobile app screens, mobile app icons, trade show pull-up banners for offshoots of ideas that didn't (and never would) exist.

I loved it.

But what I loved most was working on the web apps and the marketing websites. Since we were so small, everyone had to be trusted to make what they were doing count without much (or any) oversight. I was shocked at how much creative freedom I was given. This was the first time I was encouraged to just build. Everyone who needed to see it before it went live took their peek, gave it a nod, maybe asked for a minor tweak, then simply said "Looks sweet, man. Ship it".

We took a few cracks at different product ideas. Allinspections, the product I was actually hired to help create, couldn't find its niche and had to be sunsetted after 18 months. The CEO called me into his office in what I was certain to be my final meeting at Spatial Networks. Instead, he offered me the opportunity to head up something new: Fulcrum.

Since 2012, this has been the flagship product of Spatial Networks and my number one source of design activity. Unlike prior attempts, Fulcrum struck just the right balance of utility, ease of use, customizability, and extensibility. We were still super lean back then, but now we had people counting on our product. It felt so good to talk to customers about their issues and ideas and be able to mesh them with ours to give their companies leverage just from using our software.

Since then, we grew every month, steady as a rock. We found product market fit. Our founders understood the importance of keeping the team tight. People who didn't perform didn't last. I was responsible for the marketing website, the web app, and the mobile app design, all while continuing to support the corporate design materials and marketing for our parent company. It's wild to compare how we operate now with what we achieved back then with so little, but what I learned about simply putting your head down and shipping was invaluable.

My work
I knew I wanted to be a designer when I realized I wasn't afraid to ask to be paid to do it. I'll explain...

I went to art school where I majored in illustration and photography. Needless to say, after graduation I worked in sporting goods fitting people for running shoes (I was damn good, by the way). I never dug into how to make money with my art because I never felt comfortable with the idea of something so subjective being scrutinized in that way. Like how people who are about to get ripped off scrutinize the gleam in their car salesman's eye. 

But I was always technically sharp and to me, design was more technical. If someone needed a logo, no problem. Logos cost this much. I fell in love with design because it was the perfect combination of drawing a sublime portrait and troubleshooting my neighbor's Dell. It always starts with logos, but flyers, posters, brochures...so many brochures. When I started, web design was still young. I kept my eye on it and dabbled where I could. Eventually, it's all I did.

If design called to my logical side, the web called to my preternatural lust for improvement. When I sent that file entitled "business_card_CEO_front_FINAL_FINAL2.pdf" to the printer for that run of 10,000, the mouse-up event on the send button to his hotmail.com business address was what the racing instructors used to call a Pampers™ moment. On the web, however, I could fix a typo faster than that same PDF would load in Adobe Acrobat. I'm not condoning sloppiness, of course. But diapers do be expensive.

There's always too much to show, but somehow still not enough. The following scroll-fest is an attempt to show enough some of my best, as well as some of the work that makes me jealous (a.k.a. want to quit and move abroad to raise cattle).


Why 37 Signals? Why Now?
Software company culture is often misrepresented. People think culture can be manufactured with the right perks or free lunches or weekly challenges in Slack. "What's your favorite summer song? The one with the most heart reactions wins an Amazon gift card!"

These companies are unserious.

It's not all their fault. It takes bravery to break out of the inertia of the status quo, and it's been said that most people don't want to succeed - they just want to not fail. And when you fill your company with people like that, that's the culture that will emerge. People start turning a blind eye to obvious problems. Stagnation sets in, leading to major celebrations for effort instead of outcome because the outcomes fewer and farther between.

It's no wonder it's impossible to tell what a company is like until you work there.

But I don't want to know about your flag football league. I want to know how you work. Does the way you translate ideas into something a person can click in a web browser make sense?

Which leads me to why I'm applying to work at 37 Signals.

Over the years as the public faces of the company, Jason, David, and Ryan were always fearless pillars of transparency to me, which by itself was enough to know I wanted to be a part of whatever they were doing. Intellectual honesty like that is unconscionably rare. But when I read Shape Up in 2019, something else happened. A part of my brain I didn't know existed woke up. I felt like my eyes had been closed this whole time and now I could see what we were up against. I knew 37 Signals was lean by design, so the odds of a design position opening up at the right time were slim. So if I couldn't work at 37 Signals, at least we could work like 37 Signals. I read it on Saturday, wrote the pitch to implement it on Sunday, and presented it to product leadership on Monday. If I had anything to do with it, this was the only way I wanted to work.

As for the position you're hiring for now, a Web App Product Designer: this was the most on-the-nose job description I've ever read. While my design career covers the entire range of roles, the last half-decade was exclusively dedicated to enhancing and improving our web app. My energy comes from seeing the feature spun up on a git branch, not in Figma. My most rewarding recent work, and the thing that kept me going through some difficult changes, was working hand-in-hand with 1 developer, workshopping ideas about our feature, and finding the best way to ship something under the constraints we were given.

I have a story to tell about the arc of my 14 year-long stint with Fulcrum, but that's best shared in person over a meal. In my mind I had a plan. End my career here. But if the opportunity ever arose to work at 37 Signals...end my career there instead. I've got a few decades of great work left. Let's do it together.


For Jason Z.
I don't envy the number of portfolios and bios you're sifting through right now, so I'll keep this short. The longevity you've achieved at 37 Signals is rare in software. I'm happy to say I know the feeling. But at this point in my career, I'm looking for the last place I'm going to work. Don't get me wrong, I have decades left, but I want those decades to be stable, energetic, and productive.

So take a look around, learn a bit about me, and hopefully our gears will mesh.

All the best.




For Jason & David
It's the honesty that gets me. Nothing is impossible when everyone knows what the score is. And despite the all the great software, books, innovations, and ideas that make 37 Signals incredible, honesty is the thread that ties it all together.

If I make it far enough along for us to meet, I'll say it to your face, but in the meantime...

Thank you for always doing what's right.




For the Team
Hello, wonderful people making useful software. I'm Tim, and I'm applying to join your design team. This isn't an opportunity I take lightly, which is why I wanted to thank you, the entire group of potential future colleagues, for being an additive force to the strength of 37 Signals. Culture can't be mandated. It's an emergent property of the way you work, and preserving it over the long term is no small achievement. If given the chance, I'll do my part to add to its already sturdy foundation.

Sincerely,






All companies evolve. 


*Spatial Networks, Inc., a Data as a Service platform and eventual builder of the B2B SaaS software Fulcrum.

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
