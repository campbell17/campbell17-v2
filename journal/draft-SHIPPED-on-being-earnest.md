A personality you can touch.

- There are few things I appreciate more than someone who is so obviously and unapologetically themselves.
- An earmark of these people is they have a hint of edge to them. Perhaps more explicitly put, they have defined edges, plural. As if I could reach out and touch their personality. Like it has dimension, and a tangible perimeter. 
- And because these people are human, and because humans are flawed, I'm magnetically drawn to ones who expose those areas rather than suppressing them. But this is a paradox, because that exposure must be unconscious for it to be genuine. And few things spoil a personality quite like disingenuousness.

- For instance, everyone's heard the consummate jackass say, "hey, I'm just being honest." which, translated into the King's English, equates to "hey, I'm just being _a jackass_". They're quick to opine about things that don't matter but rarely let you see what they actually think since they're too busy transparently going against the grain.

- I'm instead talking about people who have opinions they openly share, but they express them differently than most. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I get the sense they're speaking from a place of sincerity and experience as opposed to the agenda-ridden NPC's who somehow simultaneously express their opinions loudly AND meekly, knowing in their heart there's no substance behind them.
- It's not conviction, exactly. Every asshole on the planet has conviction about their opinions. In fact, it must be in the handbook because apparently it's one of the cornerstones of being one. 
- I think instead what I'm describing is what it means to be earnest. When you look into their eyes, you can actually see the person behind them. And when they say things I don't agree with, I'm inclined to reevaluate my stance on the matter instead of trying to change theirs.
- There's a controlled chaos to the way they carry themselves, as if they're prepared to make waves at any time and adapt to whatever consequences come. Their language is plain, and what they say makes logical sense. It's the opposite of what many people are forced to endure at work: corporate speak.
- For all the fanfare around increasing communication in the workplace, you'll find no place on Earth _less_ intelligible than a meeting with a group of people who frequently use corporate jargon. You can identify these meetings by the lack of tangibility of the language therein. It's all carbs and sugar. Bland. There's no protein. No spice. No flavor. No one wants to say what has to be said because they'll be perceived as rogue. Too harsh. Not a team player. People make mistakes, but you'd never know it to hear the way people talk in the conference room. Everything is weak-tittied plattitudes. This is especially true if performance is low and things aren't going all that well. Which is ironic because that's the time when it's critical to dig into what the real problems are. But if no one is willing to cut to the bone with unvarnished vocabulary, there's zero chance the problems can even be articulated let alone solved.
- Having spent nearly half my life listening to people like this at work, maybe this is why I have such a high appreciation for people who not only speak like human beings, but are also surgical with their words. These are the qualities of earnest people and those are the people I want as my friends. They may lack sugar sometimes but I'll always know where they stand.


<!-- Well written (maybe), but doesn't fit -->
- Mixed in amongst them are the quiet. The unobtrusive. The innocuous. These are the people who exist in the millions but since they keep to themselves, they exist only in number and remain in the blind spots of all but their closest friends. 

<!-- I think this might be a different post: -->
<!-- - Part of my personality is puzzling to me and it's been on my mind for decades now. I don't care about a lot of things people tend to care about. It's puzzling because I can't tell what it is, precisely. It could be a defense mechanism to counter the chaos of things outside my control. It could be a sense that no matter what I do, I couldn't affect change anyway, so why bother. It could also just be plain old-fashioned selfishness: "If it doesn't affect me I don't want to know about it".
- Whatever it is, one of the byproducts of such an outlook is a shortage of opinions. Couple that with a hint of contrarian and it's impossible to get me to commit to even _taking_ a stance most of the time. -->


- Another nuance to consider is the air of seriousness they have. 



It was a byproduct of her personality. Had to be. No one is that level-headed in the face of such annoyance.

- Back in college, I had a young but well-traveled professor. She was a photographer, a printmaker, a digital guru (rare at the time), and a mixed media wiz. 
- In art school, there are three types of students: 
- Student one: Already good enough to work and are either about to drop out or have enough outside help to get their degree to check that box.
- Student two: 
<!-- I got stuck there - trying to describe how annoying students are one of the staples of art school undergrads -->
- One student, while annoyingly telling a self-aggrandizing story, innocuously asked if this worldly professor had ever been to New York. 
- Keep in mind, this conversation took place about a 2 hour drive from New York, door to door.
- I was behind the student so I could see my professors face as she VERY politely listened to the story, and when that question popped up, she didn't react at all. She meekly said yes, and allowed this goddamned charade to continue. 
- But I don't mean "allowed" to apply fault to her response. I mean "allowed" to illustrate how deeply she could have buried this student for thinking she was more interesting than she was. She was in the presence of one of the most interesting people in the school, and clapped on obliviously anyway.

- I am not this graceful. Given the opportunity, I always try to find a way to make myself look good. 

Notes2: Got some direction. Original story will be a piece of the main, which is now focused on the edge honest people have without being assholish. Unapologetically THEM, which sometimes includes surprising (because it's becoming more and more rare) honesty, because things aren't so great (but things also aren't so bad, and there's merit in calling out the BS of people who complain when they shouldn't). Yeah, there's a mess here to clean up still. Next time, work on the point of not being an asshole just to be one, but having SOME of those qualities as a byproduct of telling the truth. Also, explore why people like Xcal and ProZD are compelling to me because of the way they lack sugar. It's the opposite of corporate speak, which always aims to lessen the blame or perception of fault, or perception of things not going well. Because how can you fix something you refuse to say is broken?

Notes: This needs a ton of work. What's the point? Where's the ending? Make people care.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
