I really hate the word "adulting". Why? Why do I hate this word? Well, where do I usually see it? Social media. In what context? Memes. Memes about not wanting to do the things one must do. Memes about feeling too overwhelmed to perform the basic responsibilities of life. Memes about "stuff" being "so hard" that "I can't even deal". The memes always portray being an adult in some harsh and negative light.

These memes bother me.

Why? Why do these memes bother me?

Because they're all fake.

And because they're not _just_ fake, they're also completely disingenuous. These memes bother me because if exposed to these when I was a younger lad, I might just start to believe them. I might grow up in agreement that yes, being an adult _is_ harder than it should be. And if I believed that, I might start routinely complaining about adulting while I wait for someone else to do something about how hard it is. And while I wait for that, I guess I could just keep on childing since adulting is too hard and no one has come along to fix that for me.

Let me tell you something...

Being an adult is so fucking awesome that I take offense to the mere thought of a meme besmirching its good name. And the memes are insidious because they make it fashionable to be emotionally incompetent. Look at this nonsense: (show pictures of basic bitch mugs and or tchotckes)

On the surface the message seems harmless but if you look at enough of these, a theme emerges: "I'm too weak minded to get through a single day without complaining." 

But let's be generous for a moment and assume I'm missing something. Sure, maybe being an adult is hard...but what does that even mean? What parts of adulthood are under scrutiny here? I'd have to assume no one would complain about the cool parts, so let's make a list to see if we can identify some key responsibilities (omg so annoying!) plaguing adulthood:

As an average, well-adjusted adult you're supposed to:
* Wake up on time (on your own)
* Go to work (on time)
* Pay bills (on time)
* Buy healthy food
* Cook the food
* Excercise
* Pay for gas
* Call people to make appointments
* Remember all the birthdays of people you care about (and some you don't)
* Do all the chores
* Fix stuff that breaks or pay someone else to fix it
* Raise your children without abusing them (and believe me, at some point you'll want to)

That's a decent list, and that's just off the top of my head. 

It's worth noting that I consider adulthood beginning not at age 18, but after attaining complete financial independence. Once you cease borrowing money for day-to-day life expenses, congratulations. You did it. You made it. And if you and your parents are healthy and you still live with them (permanently) after age 30, I'm sorry but you fucked up.

Ok, so I'll admit that entire list is pretty annoying. But here's a question you can be sure never entered the mind of someone who complains about being an adult: *What's the bloody alternative?!* 

Every item in that list has to get done. It **has to**. So who's going to do it? What the hell are we even talking about here?

For next time: (Talk about how that list only seems insurmountable if you have ZERO going on. That list should be like breathing. Totally automatic and matter-of-fact. Because here's all the kickass shit you get to do whenever you want as an adult (maybe not just a list like that, but expand on the freedom you gain by accepting the tradeoff of that list of responsibilities. Maybe show the C&H strip where BW mentions how he can't understand people who think of childhood as an idyllic time.)




Lesson?
It's ok to take your time becoming an independent person, but only with the understanding that you're trading the meaningful for the frivilous.

*** What's the surprise? Do I put the fact that I couldn't "Adult" until I was like 30 later in the piece so that's the surprise?
Like so?: A good portion of my childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood was dedicated to _aggressively_ ignoring my responsibilities so I could stay in my walled garden. So if anyone should have sympathy for those who "just can't do adulting today", it's me.

Question about every post: (do I put a word limit on these? Most of the newsletters I've unsubscribed to have been too long to keep up with. Is this worth thinking about?)
