I really hate the word "adulting". A good portion of my childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood was dedicated to _aggressively_ ignoring my responsibilities so I could stay in my walled garden. So if anyone has sympathy for those who "just can't do adulting today", it should be me. 

*** What's the surprise? Do I put the fact that I couldn't "Adult" until I was like 30 later in the piece so that's the surprise?
