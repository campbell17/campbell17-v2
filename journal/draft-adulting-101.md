I really hate the word "adulting". Why? Why do I hate this word? Well, where do I usually see it? Social media. In what context? Memes. Memes about not wanting to do the things one must do. Memes about feeling too overwhelmed to perform the basic responsibilities of life. Memes about "stuff" being "so hard" that "I can't even deal". The memes always portray being an adult in some harsh and negative light.

These memes bother me.

Why? Why do these memes bother me?

Because they're all fake.

And because they're not _just_ fake, they're also completely disingenuous. These memes bother me because if exposed to these when I was a younger lad, I might just start to believe them. I might grow up in agreement that yes, being an adult _is_ harder than it should be. And if I believed that, I might start routinely complaining about adulting while I wait for someone else to do something about how hard it is. And while I wait for that, I guess I could just keep on childing since adulting is too hard and no one has come along to fix that for me.

Let me tell you something...

Being an adult is so fucking awesome that I take offense to the mere thought of a meme besmirching its good name. The adulting meme in insidious because it makes it fashionable to be emotionally incompetent. Look at this garbage: (show pictures of basic bitch aprons and tchotckes from Crate & Barrel with slogans about adulting)





Lesson?
It's ok to take your time becoming an independent person, but only with the understanding that you're trading the meaningful for the frivilous.

*** What's the surprise? Do I put the fact that I couldn't "Adult" until I was like 30 later in the piece so that's the surprise?
Like so?: A good portion of my childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood was dedicated to _aggressively_ ignoring my responsibilities so I could stay in my walled garden. So if anyone should have sympathy for those who "just can't do adulting today", it's me.
