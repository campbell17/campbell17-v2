The Gift of Being Oblivious
Are you aggrieved if you don't know it? (work on the subtitle)

"Hey...I saw the emails. How are you holding up? Are you ok? I can't believe he did that."

Hmm. 

What the hell is she talking about?

As I settle across the table from one of my professors to review the plan for an upcoming project, she lobs a sad, heartfelt, empathetic ball of pity my way. I catch it but I have no idea what sport we're playing, so I hesitate while I figure out if I should dribble it, kick it, or pass it back to her.

"Oh yeah, I'm fine. It's not a big deal."

People often say "I'm fine. It's not a big deal" to change the subject and avoid talking about the pain they feel. But sitting at this tiny table in this tiny conference room, there's no pain to speak of. Across from me, however, is the fifth person to broach this topic unprovoked in the last week. So it's starting to sink in I may have been wronged in some way. Apparently, I had a heated reply-all email conversation with one of the other professors last week before about some logistical decisions for a class project. One problem: I didn't know it was heated. 

I knew it was _somewhat_ contentious because we were at odds over the decision and I didn't back down right away, but I thought it a reasonable exchange of opinions. Hence my stance of "no big deal". Also, I know how reply-all works. If I noticed either of us stepping over the line, I would have simply taken the conversation out of view of the rest of the class. But I didn't. I didn't, because I didn't _feel_ insulted. According to my peers, I _was_ insulted, but I nevertheless remained unaffected. And looking even further back, this was not new behavior for me.

One Saturday back in middle school, I work up the courage to call a girl I like on the phone and ask her if she wants to hang out. She tells me she's at her grandmother's out of town, so she can't. She doesn't say, "ewww, no!", or tell me to die in a fire, or hang up on me without a word, so I count her polite excuse as a win. The following week in school, there's a buzz about a boy who asked a girl out over the weekend. This happens in tiny rural Catholic schools where the entire 8th grade is only 24 kids. But at the boys lunch table I'm confronted with the rumor that she was home the whole time and just didn't want to hang out. It seems I'm the 24th and final 8th-grader to find out. At times, the kids in this school could be vicious, so I hunched my shoulders in preparation for the inevitable ridicule. But even the nastiest boy in the class had nothing but comforting words to say. The next day, the girl and I were waiting to get picked up outside the school. It was the first time we'd interacted since the phone call and we shared a sheepish and kindred "hello". I tactfully broke the ice by joking with her that the boys at the lunch table accused her of lying over the phone just to avoid hanging out with me. Smooth. She reacted with the tried-and-true, "whaaaaaat?", and called into question their journalistic authenticity. The subject changed and we chatted until her mom arrived to pick her up, leaving me alone to contemplate my new appreciation for the complexity of adolescent courting etiquette. 

I should be upset. I used willful gullibility during our conversation to believe her, but I knew she lied. Twice now. I won't say I wasn't hurt by the rejection, but for some reason the lies didn't bother me. I rationalized them away and even gave her _credit_ for making something up to protect my feelings. I simply refused to accept that I should be upset about what happened.

What these two events have in common is my unwillingness to take others' word for it regarding how I should feel about something that happened to me. I have to make that choice. And make no mistake, once the instinctual emotion of an incident wears off, the feelings that remain are _chosen_. My obliviousness to how offended I should feel when I got lied to by a girl or publicly condescended by a professor is an exceptional tool when my goal is to explicitly avoid allowing external forces to influence my mental wellbeing. It's essentially the opposite of paranoia. The paranoid see, hear, and experience everything as a personal affront, whether they're actually being aggrieved or not. The oblivious adopt a more "they must be talking about someone else" approach.

I'd like to think I'm so evolved and cerebral that I'm a master of my emotions. So much so, that even in middle school I could compartmentalize the brutal deception of a girl I liked and float along as if nothing happened. But I assure you my cerebellum was probably too busy thinking about baseball cards, candy, and Nintendo to even notice. It turns out I simply have a preternatural ability to be completely oblivious to disrespect. Natural or not, however, this is a skill I believe is worth honing.

One detail worth mentioning lies in a small nuance shared by both stories: I was never made to feel wrong or foolish for choosing apathy over outrage. When rejected in middle school, I was consoled and even lauded for putting myself out on a limb. And in college, I received nothing but empathetic gestures of condolence from anyone who spoke to me about what happened. This was a luxury, and a critical piece unlocking the freedom to choose how I reacted. The isolated nature of the events also contributed to the ease of which I exercised my precision-guided cluelessness. If, for example, my professor continued to act unprofessionally toward me, I'd eventually have to snap-to and put a stop to it.

I consider my obliviousness a gift. It's the kind of gift you get from a distant relative who knows you're into cars but doesn't know what kind, so she sends you a set of coasters adorned with the Lamborghini logo on the off-chance you like Lamborghinis. But it's a gift, nonetheless. And I still use it whenever I want to keep the coffee rings off the end table.



In the right circumstances, obliviousness helps maintain focus on things of great import. 

Essay may be stronger without this:
<!-- When utilized properly, obliviousness quiets the part of our brain responsible for indignation and outrage - a part that seems to be growing larger every year - and helps maintain focus only on things of great import. Some people operate under the assumption that indignation and outrage are the only approprite modes of being, what with the world being "on fire" and what have you. But I'm not convinced the evidence bears that out. When I aim toward the good and try to act in a manner that directly benefits myself, my loved ones, or my community, "outrage" isn't usually the state I inhabit to achieve that. Additionally, getting good at identifying things not worthy of my attention means when my actions _do_ stray from that path and I'm criticized for it, I take notice. Because that scrutiny is directly related to keeping me on the right path. -->



- Next part, talking about how useful that is, but it comes at a deadly cost if the abuse is consistent. Maybe draw out the usefulness part, see how much ground I can cover with that. Then talk a little more briefly about the costs. Drive home how practicing this can lower the bar for being offended, allowing higher levels of focus toward the things that really matter. i,e, I dont' NEED to care about people being critical of me if my aims are toward the good and I work on putting good in the world. If I'm NOT clean (read: pure), the criticism SHOULD hurt, because I'm not acting in a manner that will benefit myself, my loved ones, my community, and the world.
- Otherwise, who fuggin cares? <-- this may need some refinement lolz

- (This might be for later) The piece of glue holding this concept together is the fact that I wasn't made to feel wrong or foolish for choosing apathy over outrage. When I got rejected, I got some uncharacteristic credit for putting myself out on a limb, one usually critical classmate even stating "I don't think _I'd_ have the guts to ask anyone out". And in the case of the email exchange, all I got were empathetic gestures of condolence from anyone who spoke to me about it.
- This was a luxury, and I believe it's one of the contributing factors permitting me to make my own choice regarding how I reacted. Which is a curious reality. Why should I allow someone else's feelings dictate how I feel about something happening to me, not them? But this part of our social makeup is important to help us avoid being victims of a _pattern_ of abuse. (not sure where this part is taking me, but wanted to get it down)



<!-- And now I'm being peppered in the hallways with looks of concern like I'm limping around with a fox trap snapped around my ankle. -->

I didn't step in a goddamn fox trap. 


What AM I SAYINGGGGG?? Being oblivious saved me from feeling wronged. (This piece is turning into me being annoyed that others were concerned for me when I didn't have a problem with it. Stop it.)


"Precision-guided cluelessness"




Let's look at the facts. My professor is shitty to me in a public email conversation as evidenced by the reaction of class members and faculty who read it. I'm oblivious to this and therefore unaffected. I'm quite fond of this professor and I we're pretty close as teacher-pupil relationships go. And it's in this last fact we find how things like this happen. 


Two things are true. One: my professor was shitty to me in a public email conversation, as evidenced by the reaction of class members and faculty who read it. Two: I was oblivious to this and therefore unaffected.

Two more things are true. One: I was quite fond of this professor. Two: We were close, and always on good terms.

The latter are crucial to understanding how something like this might happen. 

- It was a class-wide chain with reply-alls for every message, so every time I entered into conversation in the hallway, classmates and even professors brought up how bad they felt for me at being treated so poorly in the conversation. I shrugged it off, not really understanding what the big deal was.
- I was quite fond of the professor and he was a bit eccentric, so I gave him an unscalable mountain of behavioral leash (find the better word for this analogy, leash conflicts)
- The difference in perspective that [leash] gave me is an essay unto itself, but in essense it allowed my already substantial naivete and obliviousness to cloud the truth even more.
- When a third professor brought it up unprovoked in a one-on-one meeting, I finally got it. Sort of.
- Skipping ahead

- This is not new behavior for me.
- Talk about getting rejected in middle school by a classmate you asked out. Talk about how it was a tiny class and a tiny school and everyone knew that she lied to avoid hanging out with me, but I didn't.
- Talk about how even when I knew, I didn't think there was anything particularly egregious about it. And that she and I joked about it while waiting for the bus one afternoon. 
- (as I'm thinking of it, I think we joked about the fact that people said she lied, and I brought that up, and she pulled the ol' "whaaaaaaaat?" and we both scoffed at the obvious truth)
- But even though I used willful ignorance in that moment to believe her, I knew it was true. And I rationalized it away and gave her credit for making something up to protect my feelings. I mean, what would I have done?

- This part goes into the Marcus Aurelius portion of the program. No one else can tell me how I should feel about something. I have to choose how I feel. And being oblivious in this way is an exceptional tool if my goal is to avoid allowing external forces to influence my mental wellbeing.
- The opposite of paranoia is obliviousness. The paranoid hear everything, whether it's said or not. The oblivious hear nothing, no matter how much is said. Which one would I rather be? 
- I'd like to think I'm so cerebral that at 12 I could compartmentalize the brutal rejection of a girl I liked, allowing me to float along as if nothing happened. But my cerebellum was probably too busy thinking about baseball cards, candy, and Nintendo to even notice. It turns out, as evidenced by my encounter with the savagely condescending email chain from my professor in college, I have a preternatural ability to be completely oblivious to insults.

- Next part, talking about how useful that is, but it comes at a deadly cost if the abuse is consistent. Maybe draw out the usefulness part, see how much ground I can cover with that. Then talk a little more briefly about the costs. Drive home how practicing this can lower the bar for being offended, allowing higher levels of focus toward the things that really matter. i,e, I dont' NEED to care about people being critical of me if my aims are toward the good and I work on putting good in the world.

Notes: passive voice is all over this, make sure that gets cleaned up

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
