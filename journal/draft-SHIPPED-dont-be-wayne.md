I want to examine the following scenario: I meet someone. Probably at work. This person is likeable. They have a unique personality. We get along. We're easy acquaintences. In person, they are cordial, eloquent, thoughtful, and generous. I love that they exist in this world. The world needs more people like them. Online, however...this person is a goddamn clown. A troll. A bully. A shitposter.

Now what? Which is it? Are they upstanding citizens or human garbage?

They're both. And so are you. And so am I.

What do I do about this? Confront them? Tell them to be nicer? Ask them why they feel the need to be so aggressive online? Fuck no, what am I, stupid? I give up on the idea that anyone is who I think they are online OR in real life. Some ultra honest and earnest hardos will behave pretty close to who they really are, but even that's irrelevant. I look at how people treat other people _to their faces_. That's it. 

When I was in fourth grade I had two friends who didn't like each other. Let's call them Will Smith and Chris Rock. Chris teased Will, which naturally pissed him off, but then Will told me he didn't want _me_ hanging out with Chris any more. What did _I_ have to do with any of this? I didn't like the fact that Chris made fun of Will, but I didn't want to write him off completely. I asked the teacher for advice. She told me it was something I had to figure out on my own, and work it out between the three of us. "Goddammit", I thought to myself, except I was nine so it was probably more like "Fiddlesticks." I didn't understand how Chris could be so nice to me but so mean to Will, but it didn't matter. Chris had to go.

There's one problem.


When an otherwise mature, coherent person I like writes insane things online, I try to remember that the internet is not real life and that we're all a fourth-grade Weird Al in some ways.



I recently stumbled across a journal entry while I was looking through an old sketchbook. That in itself is bizarre because I never kept a journal, but for some reason I decided after a particularly bad day to write down my thoughts for, I dunno, posterity? Anyway, what I read was shocking. I thought I remembered the contents of that entry, but I clearly blocked some stuff out. I ranted about one of my roommates getting drunk and the writing took a disturbing turn when I fantasized about murdering the inventor(s) of booze so I wouldn't be subjected to his antics. Cringey melodrama aside, it was devastating to learn that I was so closed-minded towards things outside my sphere of preference.


It's hard wired into us to judge each other by our differences. How others act, what they like, their politics, morality, ideology, and so on, all combine into a representation we stuff into one of many pigeon holes in our mind. And there they remain, until something happens to cause a re-evaluation of their standing.



Though I consider this progress, at this point I'd only learned to soften my judgement of people's recreational activities. I didn't make any progress toward the differences in personalities, philosophies, beliefs, and so on. It's hard wired into us (citation needed - google, or look at Sapiens, the idea of tribalism or judging ourselves by our differences for survival/evolutionary purposes) to judge each other by our differences, and I'm not suggesting everyone gets a passing grade. But I do want to scrutinize how easy it is to judge otherwise _good_ people right out of our lives for not thinking like us.

Before social media got out of hand, it wasn't as easy to know everyone's inner-most thoughts. It might take 7 Chipotle salad bowls for me to learn that Gustavo from finance believes the earth is flat, or 13 breakroom chats with Vanessa to learn she doesn't think women should vote. Gustavo's a great guy and his flat-earth theories are harmless, so as long as he's not ardently trying to convert me, we can still hang out. But what about Vanessa? Sure, we avoid eye contact now, but she was downright saintly before we caught wind of that little secret. How extreme does someone's opinion have to be before they're considered persona non grata? I think it depends. There's a wide spectrum full of nuance, where our affinity for someone clashes with the number, frequency, and severity of their "transgressions". 

And there's a contradicting dichotomy to social media. We're able to communicate so widely yet there's a shallowness to how we do it. The lack of physical proximity to the audience coupled with the absence of empathy for people we don't personally know creates a low-remorse environment. Low remorse means our conscience taking a back seat to darker thoughts that we may not even realize we have, let alone believe. You hear celebrities talk about this phenomenon when they describe how despite being brutalized online regularly, zero (or very close to zero) people are ever negative to their face. How is this possible? One could argue that the person shitposting about Will Smith doesn't go to the same Walmart he does, so chance encounters are slim. I have another theory, though. I think we underestimate not only the powerful role conscience plays in our lives, but the vacation it takes when we communicate online. And I think if the average shitposter actually bumped into Will Smith, he would fawn all over him, tell him he loved Independence Day, and ask for a selfie next to the rack of clearance shoes that don't have boxes.

Here's what I have:

- According to this journal entry, I was very closed-minded about certain things.
- People share their inner-most thoughts on social media, so it's easier than it was before to see the crazy
- Social media is not real life, so people soften their conscience and darkness emerges
- That darkness is conspicuously absent in real life

Here's where I wanted it to go:

- I've learned not to write people off so quickly just because I don't agree with them
- Name is a clown, but I still love them and the world is better with them in it

Is this essay about judgement?








Notes for later: Continue the thought - what's the threshold for disavowing people?


Push more on the change between closed and open-mindedness, talk about how I'm lucky I made some of those mental changes before the internet age, I dunno...



When did I first discover this love? 
Why didn't I see it sooner? 
What did I do instead of loving these people before? 
Does it work retroactively? Can I think of people who I disliked before who I now love?
How has social media uncovered more lovable (and decidedly unlovable) clowns?
Who made me judge and jury?
   Was it the understanding that the world needs more of them?

The world needs more of them. (<-- Is this the ending, maybe?)




Outline/Notes (outdated)
- I love a lot of clowns. No, not clowns, but people who I consider churlish and depply flawed.
- I don't know when it happened, but the formula is something like, someone who enters the room and I roll my eyes with judgement, but I love that they're in this world and firmly believe that the world needs more of them.
- Talk about how judgemental I am, try to draw comparisons between other judgy people and people in general. 
- We're all judgy. Why? What purpose does this serve us?
- Back up the question with some theories based on research
- What do we gain by judging people right out of our lives? Is it possible to completely disagree with someone and still like them as a person? Or even love them?
- What kinds of things spark judgement in the first place? Morality. Politics. Religion. Character. Which ones are ignorable and which ones might be irreconcilable? Why?
- The role of empathy. 

What's the surprise?
Are we all clowns? 

Persona non grata formula:

but my formula is something like: Affinity(_A_) / Offenses(_O_) * Severity(_S_)(between 1 and 100) * Frequency(_F_)(times per year, estimated). If the product is less than one, that's it. They're out. So let's say I have 1,000 affinity for Gustavo. His offensive flat earth theory is one variation _O_ = 1, multiplied by a severity of _S_ = 25, and he brings it up once every couple of weeks _F_ = 26. So 1,000/O*S*F = 1,000/1*25*26 = 1.5384615385. Gustavo is still cool with me. Yay. While this formula is tongue-in-cheek, I don't think it's that far off from the calculation my subconscious does about everyone I meet.

Old opening:


Something occurred to me today. I love quite a few clowns. Not the nightmarish, something-something, more flamboyant cousin of mimes clowns. And not the irredeemable, something-something, destroy people's lives like Bernie Madoff clowns. But the well-intentioned, good-natured, otherwise fully-functioning productive citizens whose certain quirks of character illicit some of my most memorable eye rolls. God help me, I love these people.

What constitutes a lovable clown, exactly? There are only three line-in-the-sand requirements. First, you need a reasonably big personality. You can't be a clown if you're too shy to speak and consistently blend in with the floral wallpaper in the dining room. Next you need to exude positive energy. That cynical clown you know isn't a clown at all. He's just a prick. The final, and perhaps most defining trait, is the eye roll-generator. This is the tragic character flaw without which our clown would be just another outstanding person. And who needs more of them hanging around, making us all look bad?

I first discovered that I could love a clown while observing a coworker years ago. He was perennially upbeat, but like a chipper dog as opposed to an optimist. He always had the air of someone who didn't really understand what was going on, but was still happy to be there. At first I didn't know what to make of him, but eventually he became a part of the scenery. Note: I don't know where to go with this so I'm moving on.

Note: maybe scrap the above paragraph and begin the next with something like "It wasn't always this way. I used to be super judgy. Before I learned to love I felt disdain. I was closed-minded. I wrote people off."

I've talked about how frail our memory is before, but jesus. (Note: pull it out and get into some more details if relevant.) And I didn't just memory-hole a tiny aside in an otherwise coherent diary; this anti-underage drinking screed accounted for half the content. I've tried a few times to trace time forward from that moment to figure out when I softened my stance, but it's tough sledding trying to pick through that rubble. If I had to wager a guess, I probably changed my tune when I reached legal drinking age. Maybe all that animosity bubbled out of my being the consummate timid rule follower, and seeing people enjoy themselves without "permission" rubbed me the wrong way. Regardless of when it actually happened, I eventually grew out of that mode of thinking by meeting enough people who had the opposite outlook to realize _I_ was the outlier, not they.
