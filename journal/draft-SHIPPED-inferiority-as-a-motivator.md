If you feel inferior, you're in the right place.

When I was growing up, my dad had a corporate job. It was the consummate, wear a suit and tie, commute into the city, and kick your feet up with a box of Triscuits when you come home corporate job. He never talked about work, except when we visited one of his former colleagues on vacation up in Maine. He had a cabin on a lake and suggested we come up one summer to see if we liked it. I was five the first year we went. We rented a cabin just down the street from and we repeated that trip for 15 years. Every year, we devoted at least one evening to catching up with him, and this is where I got my fill of war stories from their time working in the city.

But when I was in high school, the company went through some changes and my dad was let go. He landed on his feet and everything worked out, but in a conversation we had years later, he told me something surprising. He said he often felt ill-equipped at work, despite being useful, resilient, and resourceful. I wasn't there, so I can't guarantee he was those things in the corporate environment, but he's like that for everything else so I think it's safe to assume he wasn't dicking around in his office sharpening pencils and making paper airplanes all day. He said he felt like it was always going to happen, as if they finally "found him out" for not living up to a standard too far beyond his zone of competence. After intimating this, he openly wondered if the entire episode was a self-fulfilling prophecy, during which he adopted a nagging fear he was expendable and when his tenure ended, his suspicions were confirmed.

At the time I thought it was odd that someone as competent as my dad could view himself in such a dim light. However, there's something _correct_ about continuously operating in that "I'm out of my depth" mode. I'm not sure my dad appreciated how constructive and healthy his outlook was. Humankind's default pattern is one of growth. From the collective all the way down to the average individual, getting better is the norm, not the exception. This is why hobbies exist. Quelling boredom is merely the byproduct driven by our natural tendency to learn and master new things, thus expanding our experiences. But what happens when we try a new thing for the first time? Most often, we suck. We feel out of our depth. Incapable. _Ill-equipped._

So it's a shame he felt in any way responsible for his departure because there's likely nothing he could have done to prevent it. It's the nature of large corporations for the sacrifice of entire divisions to occur when changes sweep through. So while he may have attributed the change to something he wasn't doing right, that feeling of "not quite good enough" is the exact lens through which to properly view ourselves. Believing we might get shit-canned at 4:59 on Friday is a great motivator, if used properly. The key is to let the belief wash over us like a light glaze, as opposed to caking it on thick. This way, instead of crushing us under its weight, the glaze becomes a layer of improvement that builds on itself over time. Each layer represents a little piece of development. Eventually, when we stand back and look over the whole, we'll see something full of texture and depth. So if you find yourself feeling inferior at work, you're in the right place. Get comfortable.




<!-- Cutting room floor -->
Being allergic to discomfort is one of the best ways to shrink our world down to an infinitessimal spec of fear and anxiety.

But there's a dirty little secret about this feeling: we need it. My dad didn't feel like an imposter at work because he was incompetent, he felt like an imposter at work because he was constantly striving to learn things outside his current zone of competence. It's a shame he felt in any way responsible for his departure because there's likely nothing he could have done to prevent it. It's the nature of large corporations for the sacrifice of entire divisions to occur when changes sweep through.


 He was always improving. I know this because as soon as we get comfortable at all with something new, we turn the page and start a new chapter. The tragedy of his exit wasn't that he was dismissed, but that he believed it had anything to do with _him_. The nature of large corporation sometimes leads to the sacrifice of entire divisions when a change sweeps through. It's likely there's nothing he could have done to prevent that from happening. Regardless, 




- A few things to keep in mind:
  - How this relates to me is irrelevant. I can sit this one out. Unless it adds more credibility to my opinions? I dunno.
  - Assuming you're going to get shitcanned is better than assuming you're irreplaceable - it makes you work harder
  - He didn't quit or give up despite feeling this way
  - His perspective, skewed though it may have been, may have shielded him from ego-driven emotional turmoil caused by the belief that he was too good to lay off
  - He was exactly where he should be if he felt that way

What's the ending? That he stuck it out? What choice did he have though? No one leaves a job because they feel dumb there. That he could have been happier had he embraced the discomfort? Or that his world remained open because he didn't shrink from the challenge of facing his perception of inferiority every day? That "not good enough" is the proper lens through which to view yourself, but it should be just a light glaze over you at all times. Instead of crushing you under its weight, it builds on itself and over time, eventually shining with a brilliant depth.




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller was his genre of choice. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
