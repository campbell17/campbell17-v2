Is this a memoir? An autobiography? A primer on all the things that make Product Theater its namesake?

Here's the outline for the podcast idea:

- **In the beginning…**
    - How we all came to join the company
- **Ping pong between products**
    - Geodexy, Allinspections, Fulcrum, SpatialNetworks
- **The split, the remerge**
    - Fulcrum becoming its own company, only to be clumsily merged back together
- **The acquisition**
    - CEO’s exit, new guard arrives
- **The reeducation**
    - experts gonna expert. “I didn’t get hired to NOT change the way things are done, right?”
- **The stagnation**
    - Focus wanes, the valuable piece is ignored, new fools bets are made
- **The slowness**
    - Productivity plummets as process becomes the only valued metric
- **The pivots**
    - We can’t decide what we want to be when we grow up
- **The consultants**
    - Finding ever more clever ways to waste our money for zero ROI
- **The great ITA hope**
    - Putting our eggs in one basket, and that basket is on fire
- **The goose egg**
    - We just spent 18 months talking about and poorly building something and zero people can use it
- **The re-pivot**
    - Oh yeah, I guess we should spend some time on the thing people pay money for
- **The 401killer**
    - Gobble gobble, you just took a $10k pay cut

So much has been said on Twitter about this phenomenon already. Such as:

<!-- Note for next time: Tweets go here. Find as many as you can, then start writing. You can always find more later. -->
<!-- Start with a few chapter outline versions? See what they would look like as Memoir vs. Primer - how would they differ? -->




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
