Buffett Quotes:
"If you've got a good enough business...your idiot nephew could run it."
"Invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will."

Paraphrased from Peter Lynch:
“Go for a business that any idiot can run – because sooner or later any idiot probably is going to be running it.”



Is this a memoir? An autobiography? A primer on all the things that make Product Theater its namesake? 

**NOTE: Pay VERY close attention to editorializing/moralizing - this will be one of the hardest parts to keep reigned in**

Here's the outline for the podcast idea:

- **In the beginning…**
    - How we all came to join the company
- **Ping pong between products**
    - Geodexy, Allinspections, Fulcrum, SpatialNetworks
- **The split, the remerge**
    - Fulcrum becoming its own company, only to be clumsily merged back together
- **The acquisition**
    - CEO’s exit, new guard arrives
- **The reeducation**
    - experts gonna expert. “I didn’t get hired to NOT change the way things are done, right?”
- **The stagnation**
    - Focus wanes, the valuable piece is ignored, new fools bets are made
- **The slowness**
    - Productivity plummets as process becomes the only valued metric
- **The pivots**
    - We can’t decide what we want to be when we grow up
- **The consultants**
    - Finding ever more clever ways to waste our money for zero ROI. BNR. ParaDOXXEDeees.
- **The great ITA hope**
    - Putting our eggs in one basket, and that basket is on fire
- **The goose egg**
    - We just spent 18 months talking about and poorly building something and zero people can use it
- **The re-pivot**
    - Oh yeah, I guess we should spend some time on the thing people pay money for
- **The 401killer**
    - Gobble gobble, you just took a $10k pay cut

Other chapter ideas:
- **The Interview**
  In a room with Brent, Joe, and William. Looking over a website to drill me on how I would build it. But the interview feels like a formality. Like they're just going through the motions because they already decided to hire me and just need to suss out if I'm a fraud. They as if I have any questions. The company I'm leaving has a nutcase for a CEO, so I jokingly say, "You don't happen to have a CEO who makes you work on random stuff he thinks up while on the toilet, do you?" There was a short pause followed by a long collective, "uhhhh" as they all shoot glances between each other waiting for someone to respond. I cut in quickly with the truth. "I'm just kidding, I don't need to know. Anything is better than what I'm dealing with now." I would come to know what fueled their panic.
- **Another One Bites the Dust**
  How many people can I outlast? Number at the time of this writing: 206. 206 people have come and gone since I started.
- ****  
- **This Could Work**
  After years of winging it, we grasp onto a stateroom door floating by. We're saved. We can use this door to get ashore and build up a new boat. Wait, a rescue crew is headed our way. Is that...an anchor they're about to throw us? (put this just before the acquisition - it refers to using, then losing Shape Up - as I re-read this, that's probably too specific. It had nothing to do with Shape up...it was the fact the team were open to trying it. It was the people.)
- **I got Pee in my Eye. Send Help.**
  We're going slow. Let's add a week-long product-design-engineering quarterly planning sesh full of entire day-long meetings to discuss the color of shite. That'll fix it.
- **Cheap Labor**
  Gaze upon the healthy headcount. What we lack in talent density we will surely recoup with a robust and strictly-adhered-to process. It's a machine, you see, you put people at one end and amazing software comes out the other end. Right?
- **The Sketch Widget**
  Let's not even look for an out-of-the-box solution for a geometry sketch tool. Let's build our own instead. Oh, there it is. Good thing we only wasted two weeks.
- **The Clean Ass Code Revolution**
  As our beloved product gets buggier, the language around the company starts to change. Everyone talks about quality now. Except, they forgot to aim. Our customers want quality, but our developers want to write clean code. These are not the same.
- **The Mobile SDKillMeNow**
  Let's do the same thing on mobile, except this time we DO build it and then completely git-stash all that a year later, spend 6 months talking about using out-of-the-box functionality for Mobile, and then spend another 2 months debating it more.
- **The Great Rebuild of '24**
  Suddenly, despite all evidence pointing to the opposite, we think we're capable of rebuilding the most widely used and relied-upon areas of the application. The Editor. The App Builder. The Data Viewer. In a vacuum, I welcome the idea. But my ass is sore from sitting in this chair for 4 years watching us bunt ourselves out on foul balls. Now we suddenly want to swing for the fences. Even our questionable leadership team can't approve a multi-quarter bet like this. One(1) slide deck is made to create a quote business case unquote, the senior leadership team (with the uncredited guidance of our CTO) makes the right call and claims it "needs to better align with some customer value".

So much has been said on Twitter about this phenomenon already. Such as:

<!-- Note for next time: Tweets go here. Find as many as you can, then start writing. You can always find more later. -->
<!-- Start with a few chapter outline versions? See what they would look like as Memoir vs. Primer - how would they differ? -->


False Start:

There was a before and an after. As of today, ten remain from before. We've amassed 120 "afters". Maybe five are worth a damn, and that's being generous. The rest? All goddamn n00bs.

You know when you meet someone new and immediately forget their name? Then you run into them every once in a while and you wait too long to ask. After a certain point it's been too long, and asking is out of the question. You have to hope either someone else says it in mutual conversation or the person falls into a manhole and dies from their injuries. I've been at this company for 14 years and now it's been too long. They won't fire me because my job is just nebulous enough to never pin down as redundant, but I can't quit because in the last 4 years I've done nothing worth putting in my portfolio. I design software. Or at least I used to when this company had its head on straight. Well...straight-er. To be fair, this place has always been weird, but for different reasons every year. There was that time the CEO decided to split the organization into 2 companies to each focus on one side of the business, only to say "just kidding" a year later and merge them back together. Then there was the time I was told over the phone that I can "either drive into the office to fire an employee who didn't report to me or I can tender my resignation immediately". I drove the two and a half hours only for the asshole on the phone to do all the talking himself. That same guy was later fired for sexual harrassment. Nice hire, that.

So I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the current state of this circus. But there's something different about the before and after. 4 years ago, the original CEO decided it was time to take the company to the next level, and by extension, take his exit. We took on private capital, installed new leadership, and were supposed to "board the plane to Europe" or whatever hellish corporate euphemism they proclaimed at the time. NOTE BELOW

<!-- Note for next time: I'm not skeptical by nature, but at the allhands where this move was announced, my caution heavily outweighed my optimism. (talk next about what was supposed to happen: injection of HP into the existing machine. Then, how those dreams instantly, yet somehow very slowly evaporated) -->


Idea: In the style of The Martian (chapters of diary entries set against chapters of dialogue from other characters)...how might this work...how far back could/should I go?

Constraints: only work, no romance (as such)

Risks: 
  - Can this even work? The Martian had a handful of fixed characters, but my career has been a revolving door of colleague turnover. Can I take advantage of this somehow? (Number them instead of name them, like henchmen? Maybe I can number the bosses as an homage to Office Space?)
    - Maybe I keep C, Z, B, T etc as constants?
  - How much exposition can someone swallow of undramatic office nonsense? If the exposition is compelling, does it need conflict at every turn? Or, there is ALWAYS conflict, just look for it and you'll find it. Then, "expose it".
  - Where to start / end? Do I localize this to only the current place? That would make sense for the recurring-ness of the recurring characters. I can't introduce people I've never met yet.
  - How to structure the diary vs. dialogue? The Martian had the advantage of the diary creator not knowing the dialogue people could see him, at least for a while. That was part of what made it compelling, seeing Whatney's solitary day-to-day contrasted against the circus back on Earth.
    - Maybe this is part of act 1? Me monologuing about my loathesome job at the unscrupulous company while W + C + (T, incidentally) + B + J + J are looking for me?
    - But what happens when I arrive, how does the format change? In TM, the relationships between MW and the crew were already well established, but those between MW and the brass at NASA were new.
    - Everything builds up to his rescue, it's literally what the entire novel is about. So does this first book crescendo with the phone call in the break room? If that's the case, the walk to the pizza shop, getting the first phone call to move to FL, and the subsequent Job 1 - fired, job 2 - failed, job 3 - rescued would need to be the arc. That's a long time to spend waiting during the dialogue parts. I'd need a lot of help, which might mean contacting T.
  - What if this structure uniquely works for TM but falls apart in a more mundane environment?

START:




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
