I thought I could wait her out. 

It was late. I was tired. I had 100 arithmetic problems staring up at me from their crisp off-white ditto paper. An hour ago I could have completed a few. Forty-five minutes ago I could have completed a few more. Thirty minutes ago I could have been done. But no. I decided I wasn't going to do this assignment. I was seated in the kitchen at the table in the center of the room. The light overlooking the table faded into darkness as if falling from a cliff. I was left alone for this task. I didn't know how much time had passed, but I had no intention of tending to these math problems. I thought I could wait her out.

I slouched in the chair. The smooth pleather seat let me slip down until my butt hung completely off the edge, burying my chin in my chest as the backrest pressed against my skull. I repeated this many times.

It's odd. Though I knew I had no intention of doing this math homework, I also had no intention of telling my mother this. My plan was simple. Do nothing. The point of doing nothing was to defer these problems to not-now. Maybe tomorrow, I wasn't sure, but I was sure not-now was preferable. When you're young and naive, you don't understand how responsibility works so you cling to a hope that "maybe tomorrow" could become "maybe never". This was my way of taking a stand. 100 math problems on one sheet of paper? And when I complete these, what then? WHERE DOES IT END?? So I decided to end it there. I decided I wasn't going to do any math problems. I decided to wait her out.

My hope was she would come back and tell me it was getting late. Much too late for math. My hope was I could leave my problems for tomorrow's me and whisk away to my cozy sheets on my cozy bed in my cozy room.

Well, she did come back, but she didn't say it was getting too late for math. As I've come to learn, it's never too late for math. Even if you sleep on it, it's still there in the morning, awash with the anticipation that you'll take the time to solve it.

If I organized a deathmatch of things to hate about myself, the mechanism responsible for the scenario above would emerge victorious without a scratch on him. "Don't worry about all that blood - it's not mine."

But it gets worse. That math was busywork. I knew how to do it. The teacher knew I knew how to do it. It was a rote formality and my pure conscience wouldn't permit my limbs to participate. That's the reason I refused. If it was more challenging, more engaging, or something really interesting, I would definitely make the effort and give it my best. Right?

Fast forward to seventh grade. Science class. Standing at the front of the class, the teacher got our attention and settled us down. With a glint in her eye, she announced it was time for the annual egg drop project. A contest between students to construct a housing for an egg that could withstand a drop from the school roof two stories up. For the first time I could remember, I got excited about a school project. As she explained the details, parts of my brain I didn't know existed were lighting up and I knew exactly what I wanted to build. Unlike modern versions where students split into groups and do it all in class with the materials on hand, we were given weeks to do whatever we could dream up.

Mine was to be a double-layered spherical structure. The inner sphere would be small, soft, and form-fitted around the payload. For the outer sphere, a larger latticed dodecahedron or similar mathy shape. The magic, however, was in between. I was going to suspend the inner sphere inside the outer sphere with a network of rubber bands, so no matter what part hit the ground, the inner sphere would never experience enough sudden shock for the egg to break. 

The day of the final test arrived. Everyone had their projects ready to turn in except for one student who had nothing to test. That student was told to go around the school and find something, _anything_, to put an egg in so he could at least avoid getting a zero. So at 7:55am he struck up a lovely conversation with the same lunch aide who (https://campbellseventeen.substack.com/p/the-year-was-1993)[a year later] would snuff out an ill-conceived cafeteria prank. The topic? Shipping materials. Packing peanuts and cardboard to be specific. With her help, he cobbled the "anything" together, turned it in, and put the embarrassing failure behind him.

How did this happen? How _could_ this happen? My excitement to do that project was so intense, I beamed with energy. I knew exactly what I wanted it to be. The schematic is still seared into my brain over thirty years later. And yet, the outcome was identical to that loathsome page of math problems: I never started.

One could argue this is the most roundabout characterization of procrastination ever recorded to print. And I might agree if not for the second scenario. Who avoids doing something they're stoked about? It's not as if I was afraid of failure, either, because I was naive and certain it would succeed. My problem lies in the misconception that starting is a matter of free will. Highly-effective people act. For them, starting isn't even a decision. It's like blinking or breathing. In fact, it's even more than that. It's like a heartbeat.

So avoiding my math homework only makes sense in the context of having a choice in the matter. I thought staring into space or sliding off my chair onto the kitchen floor were viable alternative options. They were not. The first step is to get good at offloading the act of starting to the same parts of your brain that handle basic functions. When faced with a sink full of dishes, for example, if I think "I should really do these" I'm already dead. I can't think, I need to act. Instead of taking any time to even form an opinion, I turn on the warm water and open the dishwasher. By the time I realize what's happening, the job is half done and inertia is doing all the heavy lifting. I can even daydream if I want. 

For simple things, that's where the job ends. But for longer-term projects, we need a way to reconnect with the inertia we established in the first place. That's where leaving a little undone when you stop for the day can work wonders. I could continue until I hit a stopping point, but if I have an open question with no idea how to resolve it, there's no thread to pick up the next day. It's better if I leave one thing undone with notes on what to do next. The next time I pick it up, I can reengage with the problem and the risk of failing to start back up ebbs away.

In a perfect world, I would have used the unpleasant experiences of those school assignments to figure all this out decades ago. Even so, it's still a grind sometimes. But if I trust the process and keep getting better at my auto-starts, hopefully I'll have a few earlier nights and unbroken eggs to show for it.



<!-- The lull between the initial spark of something new and the wall I hit when the real work starts tends to spread out, allowing the energy needed to scale that wall to drop.  NOTE: This is irrelevant now-->

<!-- Notes: describe the thing you were gonna build. You had it all planned out. The materials, the size, the geometry... except you never started. The entire marking period passed by and you never once made a list of things to get to actually build your thing. The contest came and went. You made something the day of, AT SCHOOL, from bullcrap you found around. Obviously it failed. There's another timeline in the universe where I did build that thing. I'm a happy person, but I still struggle with the same blind spot that allowed me to be so excited while at the same time never once taking action.

Not taking action is the regret. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
