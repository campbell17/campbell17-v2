Natural Life Enhancement

A few years ago, I traveled to Puerto Rico to be a groomsman at the wedding of one of my best friends. He made his brother best man, but in the months leading up to the wedding he hinted at the possibility of each of the other 4 groomsmen saying a few words of their own. So I prepared. I wrote a speech that was detailed yet brief, playful yet kind, and so witty even the 30% of the wedding patrons who didn't speak English would laugh. I practiced in my bedroom closet so my family wouldn't hear me talking to myself like a lunatic. In my mind, I killed, and I was eager to see if the reaction would match my expectations. In the weeks that followed, I ran through the delivery and timing in the back of my mind every few days to make sure I didn't clam up when my turn came.

The contents of the speech are centered around an idea I had about choosing the right friends. Specifically, "life enhancers". This is not to be confused with "natural male enhancers". They have pills for that. Or white rhino horns if you believe the stories about the illegal Asian aphrodisiac market. But I digress.

A life enhancer is someone who consistently add joy, laughter, experiences, or opportunities we wouldn't have otherwise encountered on our own. At some point we've all heard some version of the hyperbolic expression, "that took years off my life". Life enhancers do the opposite.

There are countless ways to accelerate our deaths. The activities we enjoy, our nutrition (or lack of it), and the company we keep all have different effects. Some act as rebar, bolstering our health and character, strengthening our foundation, and behaving as examples worth emulating. Others are more like coarse grit sandpaper, stripping away the years with stress, conflict, and questionable choices. We claim agency over our activities and nutrition, but I think sometimes we don't put enough stock in the company we keep. We spend our lives surrounded by others, but who are these people? Looking around at the entourage we've chosen, are these people rebar or sandpaper?

One common thread among my life-enhancing friends is they possess at least one outstanding trait I admire. But the catch is this trait only reveals itself after you've established some history with the person. Anyone can fake it for a few months, but when you see a person through enough varied situations and stress levels, their core has no choice but to surface to deal with the job. On the other hand, not everyone is at their best when the stakes get high, so there's a balancing act to perform as we judge someone's character. Judgement is a dirty word, but that's only in the context of judging someone's cosmetics. How much money they make, how they dress, where they went to school, what kind of car they drive, and so on, are not things we hold against someone. How they treat their mother, how they talk to their waiter, how they _spend_ the money they make[1], and how they talk about other people, however, are all name tags that say "Hello, My Name Is Bad Apple" and we should start injecting some distance in that friendship. 

On the other side of this coin lies the adage "there's always someone better." Usually aimed at keeping us humble, this phrase is a useful reminder of what kind of people to hang around with, especially in a professional setting. I'll fully admit, a sizeable amount of this is a result of sheer luck, but that doesn't mean we have to keep the bozos around. Ultimately, our core group of friends result from a mixture of geography, age similarity, like-mindedness, and temperament, but I think sometimes people forget they have a choice who they spend time with. Those of us who complain about our friends are doing it wrong.

I discovered a new hobby recently: Skiing. Up until a month ago, I hadn't skied in nearly 30 years. What's more, I hadn't even _thought_ about skiing in that time. But today, I'm obsessed. It felt pretty fun when I did it in high school, but it was nothing like this. It's what I visualize as I fall asleep and what I think about when I wake up. My wife and I are planning travel around it, that's how bad it is. I could have gone the rest of my life without experiencing the joy this brings me (and with luck, the rest of my family when we all take lessons next year). My point? Guess who was generous enough to invite my son and I on the annual ski trip he takes with his brother to Colorado? A well-chosen friend. 

A simple gesture can add immeasurable amounts of enrichment to someone else's life. Let's keep reminding ourselves to add to the lives of those around us rather than grinding away their remaining years with negativity, stress, and pettiness. As for the wedding speech...I never had to give it. My friend's brother gave his at the reception and it was concise, heartfelt, and said all there was to say about my friend. The other groomsmen and I decided that was plenty. So we all applauded, kept eating, and that was it. Then we danced. That wedding was killer. And I remembered to thank my friend for the invite.

[1] This one depends...someone being "bad with money" isn't necessarily a world-ender, but if they're too far gone it will cause us to be worse with _our_ money because we could do almost anything frivilous and it would pale in comparison.

<!-- Notes for NEXT TIIIIMMMME (sing-songed like the narrator of a Hanna Barbara cartoon): Maybe add the people you admire part. Maybe add something about the skiing? Add the ending. -->



Ending: Oh, by the way, I never had to give the speech. My friend's brother gave his at the reception and it was concise and heartfelt. I think we groomsmen all decided it was plenty. So we all just clapped and kept eating and that was it. And then we danced. That wedding was killer.






- We've all heard some form of the expression, "that'll take years off your life." But what about the opposite?

- There are different ways to accelerate your death. The activities you practice, the fuel you choose to intake, and the company you keep all have different grit levels. The worse for your health, the coarser the grit, the more longevity it strips away.

- We have agency over our activities and fuel, but sometimes we don't put enough stock in the company we keep. We're surrounded, but who are these people? Do they strip away at your life or do they add to it?

- Become friends with people you admire in some specific way. If you can't manage that yet, add some distance to friends who make you look saintly by comparison. The adage "there's always someone better" is aimed at keeping us humble, but it should also be a reminder to surround ourselves with those very people. (Strike a balance, though, their 'betterness' should be just around the corner from yours...something attainable or at least aspirational and not so super-human you feel inferior when you spend time with them.)

- Likewise, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind of person who adds stress to others? (<--- strengthen the hell out of this)





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
