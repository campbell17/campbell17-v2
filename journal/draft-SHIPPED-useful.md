Being useful for its own sake.

- What happened to us? Have we become so self absorbed we unilaterally decided not to lift a finger without compensation? 

I recently rewatched two Studio Ghibli films, My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. Amidst all the breathtaking art and compelling storytelling, I was struck by something I hadn't noticed the first time around: how the protagonists, both young girls from Japan, make themselves useful.

Immediately upon their introductions, Satsuki (age 10) and Kiki (age 13) project conspicuous amounts of energy, offering to take on mundane chores with the excitement of a child perusing the dessert menu. And this got me thinking. There's something strange about the way we perceive our usefulness. Rather, there's something wrong with the way we view our _lack_ of usefulness. 

When I was growing up, there's nothing I wouldn't say or do to get out of being helpful. If it meant anything other than playing, I turned into Randy Jackson from American Idol: "Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me, dawg." Once when I was 12, my dad left the vacuum out in the basement for what must have been weeks. It was a finished basement with a TV, my video games, some Nerf balls, and a smattering of sports equipment. I was the only one who spent any time down there. As I stood beside the vacuum getting yelled at for keeping my play room in a constant state of disorder, it was pointed out to me that in the hundred times I must have walked around it in my travels, not once did it occur to me to plug it in and, you know, suck up some carpet dust. Due the fact that I had zero history of being proactive in the cleanliness department and that no authority figure had explicitly asked me to actually do anything to or with the vacuum, one might understand my sneaking hunch at the time that a great injustice was playing out. Leaving that aside, however, I can see how my dad would feel it was a perfectly logical expectation that I, the only person who used that area, would take ownership of its upkeep and be grateful someone brought me the vacuum. To this day, gun to my head, I can't tell you where we kept the vacuum in that house. I can't even narrow it down to which floor, let alone which closet we stuck it in. Such was my blindness to how utterly useless I was.

So when I tell you my youngest child reacts like he's been selected for institutional torture when we ask him to help bring the groceries in from the car, you can seek comfort in knowing it's not just this generation of kids who take on uselessness as their identity. This is why the first few minutes of those films left me astounded. I was arrested by the disparity between the attitudes of those characters and my attitude as a shiftless youth.

I've always struggled with the interplay between preparing my children for the real world and letting them be "kids". This plays out differently for different cultures – just Google "Tiger Mom" for a small taste – but I can't help feeling like there's a misconception in American culture that "letting kids be kids" means alleviating them of any sense of responsibility for the rote maintenance routines every functioning adult undertakes on a daily basis. Even worse, I have a habit of intervening too early when one of my children begins to struggle with something, either showing them how to figure it out or doing it for them. It takes hawkish mental vigilance for me to bite my tongue while they figure things out.

I had a friend in college who watched nothing but Japanese TV shows. There was a little bodega where you could rent VHS tapes of popular variety shows from Korea and Japan, and every week he'd come back to the apartment with a fresh stack. We must have watched hundreds of hours. There were no subtitles, but the shows were so entertaining it didn't matter. The shows all featured pop stars playing silly games and doing musical numbers, but every so often they would feature a more sober, pre-taped vignette about one of the celebrities. It was during one of these interludes I caught a glimpse of a different parenting approach than I'd experienced. The clip showed the man asking the child, who couldn't have been more than 4 or 5, to do a trick on a jungle gym bar. First, he demonstrated how to do it, then motioned for the boy to try it. The boy couldn't do it. The trick wasn't necessarily difficult or technical, but it was a fraction outside the boy's comfort level. He gestured for the boy to try again. He did, but still couldn't do it. But instead of saying ok and letting him give up, as I would likely have done by then, the man sat back and encouraged him to keep trying until he achieved it. The boy kept trying a few more times, but finally lost his will to do the trick and wanted to stop. The man insisted. Even as the boy cried and pleaded to give up, the man, calm as could be, insisted. At the time, I thought this was cruel. He was so young, I thought, and I didn't understand why an adult would put a child through this to achieve what I assumed was a pointless trick on a playground jungle gym. But looking back, it's more obvious what was happening. The man knew the boy could do it. The boy, on the other hand, decided after a few attempts that he could not. Thus, he adopted a self-imposed limit, which allowed him to believe he was permitted to give up. In standing his ground, the man was teaching the boy that his opinion of a task's difficulty is just that. An opinion. And when the boy finally achieved the trick, he learned those self-imposed limits can be disproven with enough persistence.

This aside isn't strictly related to how useful that child may or may not become, but it speaks to a difference in perpective for how capable we believe our children are. It's not fair to my kids to protect them from what it feels like to struggle or fail, nor is it fair for me to allow them to think being unhelpful is a trait worth keeping. The first time we asked my youngest child to empty the dishwasher, he almost hyperventilated. My weakness tried to convince me he was too young and making him do chores would rob him of his childhood. I'd be robbing him of something, sure, but it wouldn't be his childhood. Fast forward a few weeks, and he only huffs once, then gets after it. In time, with enough patient guidance, maybe he'll be the one to ask if there's anything he can do to help.

There's something fundamental about usefulness. Something core. Something atomic. Utility is directly correlated to the concept of evolution. If something isn't useful, eventually it gets selected for deletion. When I was a kid, I tried to avoid doing things that weren't categorized as fun. I thought doing too much banal activity would somehow steal away my youth, as if it were a zero-sum game. What I ended up stealing, however, was a chance to establish a pattern of behavior that would become the bedrock of positive self-worth. 

I thought rushing toward responsible adulthood would only add stress and anxiety to my life, so I put it off. Looking back, the phases of my life where I was the most depressed were the precise times I was holding myself back when I was supposed to be growing up. I know this because as I grew older, and my craving to be more useful finally increased, something interesting happened. I got happier.




Two things cured me of this mental disease. Getting married, and owning a home.

- Describe what they did to make themselves seem useful. This isn't a film review, so keep it general.
- Talk about how I felt when I was a kid, how my kids feel every time I ask them to do something.
- Is this cultural?
- What could be done differently?
- I remember I saw a clip of a Japanese show where a father was asking his 3 or 4 year old to do a trick on a jungle gym bar. The boy couldn't do it, but instead of saying ok and letting him give up, the father sat back and encouraged him to keep trying until he achieved it. The boy cried and kept trying to stop, but the father insisted. At the time, I thought this was cruel. He was so young, I thought, and I didn't understand why a parent would be so harsh. But looking back, it's obvious the father was acting as a coach, pushing the child beyond his self-imposed limit, to teach him that his opinion of a tasks difficulty is just an opinion he can disprove with enough persistence. 
- When I used to ask my youngest child to help bring in the groceries, he acted like he'd been selected for institutional torture. 
- It's not fair to my kids to protect them from work. It's allowing them to live under the false pretense that it doesn't exist. The first time my youngest had to empty the dishwasher he almost hyperventilated. My weaknessess tried to convince me he was too young and it would rob him of his childhood to make him do chores. I'd be robbing him of something, for sure, but not his childhood. His usefulness. And being useful is a cornerstone of self-worth. 
- I wish I'd been more generous with these lessons. In essense, I'm passing on uselessness disguised as an unwillingness to deal with the discomfort of my children's protests. That Japanese father in the playground wasn't cruel, he was giving. He was giving his son the gift of work ethic, a pattern the 4 year old would follow the rest of his life. 
- There's something fundamental about usefulness. Something core. Something atomic. Utility is the only unanimous marker for evolution. If it isn't useful, eventually it gets selected for deletion. 
- Who qualifies: You're helpful. Willing to help. Which means you're generous with your attention and your time. You're handy, or at least have the ability to conceptualize how things might work. You're curious. You're willing to try. And you're willing to learn. More importantly, you're open to the possibility that you don't know some things, and, crucially, some of the things you do know might be inaccurate. Being right about something is less important than doing something right. This means you might also know some things. Curiosity leads to knowledge and, given enough time, wisdom if you pay attention. Paying attention is another big one. Carelessness as a result of speed sometimes happens. Carelessness in the absence of attention should not. 
- Useful people get the benefit of the doubt. They're lightning rods for opportunity. When companies downsize, they're the people worth retaining.
- We all begin life as useless. When compared with other mammals, it's one of our defining characteristics.


<!-- - Notes for next time and Possible ending vibe: But if all else fails, if you can't seem to blah blah blah, and if maybe you blah blah blah blah. Or you can't _____ And sometimes you can't even bear to ______...At least be useful. (I dunno, something about being terrible at everything someone could be terrible at, but at least you're useful? I dunno of those are too contradictory. How could you be so terrible while still being useful? That's a good question, actually. How bad can someone be while still being useful? Something to explore next time) -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
