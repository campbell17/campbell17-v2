My cheat sheet to cultivate balance. YMMV.

- If you want to change someone else you have to change yourself first...
- ...but you'll never do either if you're even mildly dishonest.
- If something is broken, try to fix it before throwing it out.
- If you live with people but you're energized by solitude, wake up hours before them. It's easier than it sounds.
- If the only thing stopping you from an opportunity is fear, you have no choice but to do it.
- If you're caught up in conflict, you're at least half the reason it exists.
- If other people got away with it, you certainly will not. Murphy's law is real.
- Relationships are everything. People are everything. You can sustain a shitty job with great people, but not the other way around.
- If a friend dissapoints/angers/stresses you out all the time, they're not a friend. Get rid of them. They'll find other friends. They'll be fine.
- Don't post on social media unless: 
  - It's directly relevant and necessary for your career.
  - You make things with your hands and want to share the process/results.
  - No one wants, needs, or cares about your opinions and hot-takes.
  - No one needs to see you dancing.
  - No one needs to see you reacting to things other people did.
- Don't seek out negativity. You see what you look for. If you think the world is burning, there's no shortage of commentary incentivized to reenforce that view.
- If you don't like where you live, plan a move.
- When it comes to work, there's no such thing as overprepared.
- 

Can't seem to get off the ground. Here's the latest false start:

<!-- - {{[[TODO]]}} Is it a skill to refrain from co-opting others' pain unnecessarily?
    - How much is useful vs. how much is selfish/insensitive/uncaring, etc etc

When you find out someone you never met died, do you get sad? No, right? Why would you? You didn't know Janice. But what 

Notes for next time: I used to feel something. Now I feel a split-second pang of killed buzz, but then I feel nothin'. Does it depend on the death? Is an OD the same as a tragedy? Does horrified count? Being affected by it isn't the same as feeling sad about it. What about the person's contributions, and those future contributions that will never be realized? -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
