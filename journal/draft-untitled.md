On a dreary day back in 1987, I made a commitment to a philosophy I didn't even know existed. I could scarcely pronounce the _word_ philosophy let alone subscribe to one, but there I stood in the upstairs hallway staring through the darkness at my parent's bedroom door, making a decision that impacts me every day. I was 8.

We make thousands of decisions every day. What should I have for breakfast? Should I go to the gym today? Do I covertly fart during the sermon or wait until we all get up to sing the next hymn? Some coin flips are riskier than others. But rare is the choice we make that stands out among others as life-changing. Rarer still is one we're able to identify as such. This is because the most reliable way to change your life is to make tiny alterations to your habits and trust in the law of compound interest[1] grinding away in the background. I suppose the other extreme is hitting rock bottom, which frames the change as a matter of sheer survival. I guess this is what happnened to me.

For a modicum of perspective, let me not paint my childhood self as some sort of misfit who, at the end of my fifth bender in four weeks, had no choice but to turn my life around. Let it instead be stated that rock bottom for this eight year-old wasn't very deep. It was like rock bottom of the kiddie pool. But at that age, if you're incredibly lucky like I was, you don't really know what real hardship looks like so it's all relative.

[1] In (very) layman's terms, compound interest allows exponential growth of wealth over long periods of time by investing modest amounts consistently. **Consistency** and **time** are the critical pieces. Google it and poke around for a more by-the-book description.

Notes for next time: Talk about the pattern lying and how it made me feel, caveat it with the fact that all kids lie. Try not to paint myself as a martyr or a hero. Go into the tactics and implementation of my decision. Did I think it would be hard? I don't think I did - I remember it just being something I put behind me after I decided it. Then talk about why that is. Briefly touch on the 100 v. 98 philosophy and tie that into me practicing without knowing it was even a thing yet. Talk about other things that philosophy works with, but don't belabor it. Return to the idea of staking a claim in your own life, then immediately putting those choices behind you as you start down the new path. "This is the new way now. I can't give a shit about how things used to be." Maybe quip about how there are only two modes of being? - acting like you give a shit, and "can't giving a shit". Wrap up by talking about giving credence and conscious acknowledgement to those times when you hit a mini-rock bottom. You don't have to be face down in a ditch to make those choices, excellent forcing functions though they may be. Maybe a note about how only one of these decisions in your life can show you you're capable of literally anything. It's not like discovering cold fusion or splitting the atom. It's more like tying your shoes for the first time. If you did it once, you can do it again.






This might be redundant: As with any story based on memory, the particulars have faded with time, but the moral of that decision has survived decades of erosion and continues to shape me.

Notes for next time: Change title - too much saturation of 100% rule. Do I even write this? Maybe the 100% rule is just a footnote instead of the main idea. Gonna change the title now so I don't have to look at it any more.

More notes: Is this about honesty? Is this just a humble brag that you had the fortitude to make a life change at such a young age? What's the surprise of this story? No one wants a flawless hero, so talking about how great you are at telling the truth is uncompelling.
