I don't love it.

Dirty Jobs. Remember that show? I know Discovery recently revived it, but I haven't seen the new ones, so to me it still feels cancelled. The format remains unchanged as host Mike Rowe treks across America meeting people from all walks of life who all have one thing in common: their work is filthy. Hence the name of the show. The premise focuses heavily on the necessary, indespensible nature of the work and the fact that despite its repugnance, these intrepid souls soldier on every day. They're the "someones" in "it's a dirty job, but _someone's_ gotta do it".

Being a dyed-in-the-wool believer[replace with better word] in the value of the trades, Rowe often dedicates a short soliloquy to spotlight an easily overlooked aspect of the happy lives these dirty jobbers cultivate. They do not _love_ what they do. Or at least they didn't when they first embarked on their begrimed journey. These roadkill scoopers[1], pig farmers[2], worm grunters[3], and diaper cleaners[4] were not following their passions to fame and glory, but they're enjoying financialy stability and a sincere sense of purpose nonetheless.

- Do these people stare out the window while sipping their Sunday coffee and daydream about passions left unchased?
- Maybe they didn't have anything else they really loved? Or even liked? Maybe they're awash in the relief that they at least found one thing they can focus on.
- It's hard to make steep progress when your interests vary wildly.
- I like all kinds of stuff, and I get very interested in certain hobbies. But I never get OBSESSED. And I have a nagging fear that obsession is necessary.
- But not everyone is a rocketship. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
