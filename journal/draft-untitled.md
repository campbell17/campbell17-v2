When I was 8, I made a commitment to a philosophy I didn't know existed. I could scarcely pronounce the _word_ philosophy let alone subscribe to one, but there I stood in the upstairs hallway staring through the darkness at my parent's bedroom door, making a decision that impacts me every day. 

This might be redundant: As with any story based on memory, the particulars have faded with time, but the moral of that decision has survived decades of erosion and continues to shape me.

Notes for next time: Change title - too much saturation of 100% rule. Do I even write this? Maybe the 100% rule is just a footnote instead of the main idea. Gonna change the title now so I don't have to look at it any more.

More notes: Is this about honesty? Is this just a humble brag that you had the fortitude to make a life change at such a young age? What's the surprise of this story? No one wants a flawless hero, so talking about how great you are at telling the truth is uncompelling.
