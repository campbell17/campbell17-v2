What was I talking about? Oh yeah, the BnB.

I arrived at night to the ski town of Mont Tremblant. My passenger seat was empty, save for an empty [specific food wrapper], a [something second], and the wrinkled inkjet pages scrawled with MapQuest's finest navigations. I could tell the pedestrians glancing through my windshield knew I didn't know where I was or where I was going. I could just _tell_. It was after 10pm and I was surprised how busy the town was. I always forgot other people actually like to leave the house once in a while. It was a fools hope to be invisible in a car with a cracked windshield, a dented quarter-panel, and New Jersey plates. I was hard on my little Integra.

Some watched me pass without looking, as one does in conversation between rounds of eye contact. I crawled along between stop signs looking for my turn. The light of the town faded as I left it far behind me. Normally, fear of the darkening path would lead my mind to wander into thoughts of getting stopped along the road somehow, overpowered and subdued by a burly man of the bush, and chopped into meaty chunks via off-season snowblower. But this was Canada. The worst they would do is offer me their worst maple syrup as a cruel joke, not knowing it was still better than what I could get at home. With warm Belgian waffles now dominating my subconscious, I saw my turn pass without a hint of a throttle-lift. I slowed to initiate a U-turn without stopping, afraid my syrup-laden fantasies would prove an overestimate of Hoser hospitality.

The sound of a car coming up the gravel road coupled with the unfilled entry in his logbook stirred the owner of this remote Bed & Breakfast enough to turn on the light above the entrance door. Looking at the humble sign next to the humble side-door, I opened the car door to the sobering understanding that a hotel and a Bed & Breakfast are not the same thing. A fact made only more real by the very real and clearly puzzled older couple who answered my knock on their door. Their puzzlement puzzled me, as I would have thought these kinds of things went with the territory of proprieting accommodations for strangers for a living. But as this was my first exposure to the world of non-chain-hotel travel arrangements, my guesses are as follows: (1) They normally do not receive guests this late. By the time I relieved my overworked and underappreciated 1.8 liter 4 cylinder Honda engine for the night, she'd been revving through the gears and droning on the interstate for 10 hours, cementing my arrival at a few minutes past 10:30pm. (2) They did not expect the face of what any reasonable person would perceive as an unaccompanied minor to be the only one standing at the door. Proving this hypothesis out further, the husband even peeked over my right shoulder toward the parked cars to see if my parent or guardian was presently in tow. I regretted my decision to shoot first and ask questions later vis-a-vis booking this so-called non-chain-hotel the way people who think they want to commit suicide regret jumping from great and tragically unsurvivable heights, only to learn that their every problem had viable solutions except the problem they just caused: a terminally aproaching meeting with the earth's surface. Luckily the moment passed, and with this awkward exchange of bludgeoned expectations behind us, they cordially invited me in.

The interior had the countenance of an old Norse lodge, with an expansive open atrium surrounding a stone hearth, an open staircase to one side which led up to the guest rooms, at the base of which was a long table reclaimed from what appeared to be a dining hall for Vikings. The polished onyx-colored planks making up the top looked to be cut straight from an ancient war ship. The next morning I'd be eating sunny-side-up eggs over a square of lumber where the blood of ones enemies was spilled. Neat. They told me the breakfast hours and directed me to my room, and with the final occupant accounted for, we all called it a night.

For breakfast, along with the eggs and bacon, I was served a helping of reassurance that my choice in accommodations wasn't as outlandish as I thought. Two other drivers from my race group were also staying there. Both were in their forties and both had families, careers, and well-established lives. In other words, they had something to lose. This is only relevant to illustrate that they were there for fun while I was there on business. My presence was scientific. The hypothesis I wanted to test was whether or not my most recent racing experience was an accurate depiction of my level, or just a bad day at the office. I was half their age, still figuring out what my life would be like. I wanted to do more than just participate that day. I wanted to _push_.

Their names long escape me, but one was an American from New England somewhere and the other was French Canadian from just around the corner. They were both kinder than I was expecting. I saw them in a competitive light and I assumed they would do the same, but now that I'm older than they were at the time, it's clear to see the differences in mindset between a single-minded naive twenty-something and a pair of middle-aged family men. Everything seems so important when we're young because there are so few things happening, relatively speaking. To them, this was merely an aside. A way to have a little fun and get away from the pressure and gravity of being the responsible, appointment-keeping, tax-paying, shed-building, lawn-mowing, early-waking super glue of society. But to me, this was the biggest, most important thing I would do all year. It would prove or disprove the ongoing self-assessment, or rather, my very ability to accurately judge my own abilities. Abject failure would mean recalibrating a great many things I thought about myself. So for me, the stakes were steep.

After completing the breakfast portion of Bed & Breakfast, we had a long day in store. We lapped. We laughed. I met a girl. I forgot to get her number. A dozen of us packed into an enormous Dodge Ram Van that was about as long as the short school bus. You wouldn't think someone could powerslide in one of those, but the instructor showed us how it was done. He then regailed a story about one of his colleagues the prior week entering into a similar slide and not being able to recover it, sending the whole group into a lazy spin. For his part, our guy stayed on track. 

More beats:

- We lapped between 9am and 5pm, alternating groups every ten laps or so, with a break for lunch in the middle
- I met my girlfriend but neglected to get her contact information
- The instructors took us around in an econovan and did things I didn't think physically possible in a van on a racetrack
- My fireproof suit was too small, my fireproof shoes were too big.
- While out of the car, receiving instruction and watching the other group, we baked in the sun. 
- The seat was tighter than I remember from Road America, and every time I pulled the sequential shifter to go up a gear, I rattled my elbow on the frame of the monocoque. This would only be discovered the next day when I woke up with lobster red skin everywhere except my elbow, which was dark putple.
- At about midnight on the drive home, I alternated closing each eye so I could pretend I was getting some sleep. I was windows-open, radio-on, face-slapping tired. 
- As for the timesheets...they printed out the sheets and ranked everyone based on our best lap of the session. Group A was comprised of the drivers who had the most seat time. Group B, my group, was for the beginners. According to the data, the crushed nethers, drowning feet, sun-burnt face, and decimated elbow couldn't slow me down. I took the top spot in my group in session one and didn't relinquish it all day. And looking at Group A's times, I learned I was quick enough to break into their top ten.



<!-- I made the decision to do it, planned it out, packed up, drove all the way up there, took part in the event, and drove home that same night. <- This doesn't have a good place -->


Let's put some beats down:

- feeling like I would never find the road
- the miracle of finding the wooded entrance in the dark
- the bewildered Bnb proprietor letting me in at 10 or 11 - whatever it was, it was later than they were expecing, it seemed
- Me only realizing at that moment that this wasn't a hotel. I wanted to rethink the whole thing, but in for a penny, in for a pound
- It was a lovely lodge, wasn't it
- Waking up and eating breakfast - how did I wake up on time? Cell phones always had alarms. 
- Meeting a few of the other drivers. One American, one French-canadian. Both super friendly. 
  - They were at different places in their lives - children, careers, something to lose. At the time I assumed this is what made them more tentative on the track
- Based on my lack of life experience, I had no business coordinating and executing and event like this. But that trait was ultimately responsible for exactly that. In the words of Dave Chappelle's friend Chip, I didn't know I couldn't do that. (obviously leave the chappelle part out)
- I was there on business, which was another difference between me and the dads with BMWs. I was there to test myself. Though doing so would be fun, I wasn't there to have fun, per se.


- Onto the event - does this need its own post, or can it be tacked on to the Bnb part? 
  - A group, B group. I was in B group because of my lack of experience. The timesheets had me at the top of B, middle of A. 
  

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
