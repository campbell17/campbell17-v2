Thank your demons

- Pain in the ass people leave a mark on us. 
- But if you have any sense, and if you do it right, you can turn their toxicity into fuel for self improvement.
- There are a number of types, but I'm heavily experienced in two, specifically: the Bad Example and the Critic.
- The Bad Example is someone close to us who spends most of their time stepping in various avoidable bear traps. They're the king of the own-goal. Foot snipers. And they have foot-in-mouth disease.
- The Critic is the over-honest purveyor and arbitor of how we conduct out business, pointing out flaws in our process, logic, execution, and reasoning.
- These people are a pain in the ass. Because you love them. Sometimes you wish you didn't, but wishing will never change that.
- But there's hope. Acute, sustained observation of the Bad Example, for example, produces a topographic map of many of life's wrong turns. In addition, the pain these people cause other people you care about give us the extra push we sometimes need to improve the way we act, making us better overall.
- If you have a Critic in your life, hopefully they're not family. You can't get rid of family as easily as you would a significant other or a friend, thought those are tough to break off as well. But in the meantime, while you're weathering the storm, approach this person's PITA-ness as an opportunity to learn more about some of your rough edges. In many cases, these could use some sanding and refinement, making you a better, more well-rounded person. This will come in handy for the next person you meet, as many of your most obvious flaws will have been brow-beaten out of you.
- This guy
- This, of course, only applies if you want to improve. If you think you're perfect, you're probably one of these bastards I'm talking about.
- 

Pain in the ass people leave their mark on us. They complicate things, add stress to our lives, and worst of all (change this to something like "and this part is obvious"), they have no idea how much of a pain in the ass they are. While we'd like to organize our lives to exclude these types of stressors, sometimes contact with these people is unavoidable.

Notes: name why they have to be in our lives and what to do about it.

I'm all for curating my life to jettison as many stressors as possible, but sometimes the presence of these people is not optional

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
