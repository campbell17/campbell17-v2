Wild hairs

Why is TODAY the day?

When does something I want to do get moved into the something I'm _doing_ category?

Let's say I want to clean out the garage. And I know I will clean out the garage at some point. But when _now_ is the moment I refuse to wait another day, why is that? Why is TODAY the day?

My old photography professor used to say, there are a million excuses _not_ to do something. He said this in reference to the lack of seriousness his students often displayed when it came to motivation, procrastination, and deadlines. At my first design job, whenever anyone was indecisive, a wise colleague would say, "Shamon![1] Staple some nuts on." In other words, _get on with it, dude_. The point is, there ARE a million reasons not to do something. So what does it take to finally silence those voices and staple on our proverbial nuts?

I love the phrase "forcing function" because it succinctly describes the mechanism through which progress is born. If I'm standing next to a stranger at the bus stop, the possibilities for what needs to happen next are completely up in the air. I may strike up a conversation, pull out my phone to check email, or try to covertly shift my weight to get rid of my wedgie without using my hands. But what if I'm at the bus stop and a stranger collapses on the ground? That event eliminates every possibility except one: "Hey. _Tend to that._"

Some forcing functions, like the collapsing stranger, rise up out of the ground suddenly like the undead, leaving us no choice but to address them immediately and directly. But most of the time, they are arbitrary, time-based restrictions. A time-based forcing function is an eggheaded way to say "deadline", and most often refers to finishing something. I'm more curious about starting things I don't already have to do. Personal pursuits are voluntary. I'm not getting paid, no one is asking me to do them, and the outcome won't materially change much about my life. So why do them at all?

Enter: The Wild Hair. 

Wild hairs are responsible for more action and innovation than MIT, NASA, and DARPA combined. Ever since cavemen saw lightning-induced fire and thought, "I bet _we_ could make some of that", wild hairs have been the tip of the spear of progress. Wild hairs come in two varieties: yours and someone else's. And we only give a shit about one of those. In fact, one of the marks of an effective leader is to persuade others to believe _your_ wild hair is actually _their_ wild hair, but I'll leave the examination of that topic for another day.

For now let's focus on ours. Sometimes, when I'm on the couch minding my own business, I'll hear my cat warble loudly from the other room before tearing ass all across the house like she's being chased by a demon. My youngest son calls it "the zoomies". That's the feline version of the wild hair. Unfortunately for her, not only is she an idiot, but she has no opposable thumbs. Sprinting for her life is the most she'll ever accomplish with her wild hairs. By contrast, we have big wrinkly brains and many thumbs, so harnessing ours is only a matter of taking action.

But a wild hair is more than just an idea. A wild hair is an idea with motivation already baked in. It sidesteps the part of our brain responsible for the million reasons of inaction and puts it directly on the conveyorbelt. No debate required. The last piece of the puzzle is to make time for action to take place. Notice I didn't say find time. Finding time is for all the other things we push off with procrastination. note: check if you've written about this rule, adjust if so: Warren Buffet has a 5/25 rule. In short, the idea is to make a comprehensive list of 25 things you want to accomplish, large and small. Next, prioritize the top 5. Finally, _vigorously avoid_ the other 20. The essence of the rule is avoiding distractions... note: gotta check to see if I've written about it before finishing the sentence... pick up here: I find it easier if I push that concept even further. I pick one. More accurately, one picks me. That's what a wild hair is. It's one idea you have to do...

Notes for next time: pick up here (above).

when we're able to combine a forcing function with the wild hair, giving me not only the thing to do but the motivation to get after it. I can make a todo list as long as a Walgreens receipt, but if I don't add an extra layer of necessity, ain't nothing getting done.

[1] According to Urban Dictionary, "Shamon" is the distinctive deliberate mispronunciation of "come on" used frequently by Michael Jackson. And my wise colleague, apparently.

Notes for next time: continue the last sentence, talking about external forces becoming forcing functions. Then move on to lists, top 5 stuff, and maybe other types of motivations. What happens when something just dies on the vine, never to get done?



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
