You're only hurting yourself.

When I was in college I worked at a sporting goods store. It was a standard (define standard) retail job - [do things, do other things, talk to people, etc <- describe what made it standard here>] - but this company was a bit unique in that it heavily emphasized excellence in customer service. If you've ever been to a Foot Locker in the mall (or almost any modern brick & mortar retail store, for that matter), you may have noticed the absense of helpful, knowledgable staff. There are people who work there, sure, but most of them are just waiting for you to leave so they can go back to scrolling or talking shit about their manager while they refold the shirts you so rudely tried on.

My store was not like this. City Sports in Center City Philadelphia in the early 2000's was the place you went when you needed the right thing but you didn't know what that thing was. But we knew. "I need a new pair of running shoes" was our favorite phrase because it meant we could show off our hard-won knowledge about the intricacies of the shoes and how to fit the perfect model. In contrast, "you got them new Jordan's?" made us sad and we took our sadness out on the customers when we told them to try the Foot Locker on Chestnut street.

But this essay is not about comparing the inventory of a high-brow establishment such as ours to that of the workaday Foot Lockers of the world. Rather, it's to examine the perspective required to maintain that high-brow culture.

The shoe wall was at the back of the store. Though placed deep within, past the towering ediface of backpacks, the maze of high-end yoga pants, the smattering of team sports equipment, and the tennis racquet restringing apparatus, the shoe wall was City Sports' defining feature. But being in the city, space was at a premium. So through a door at the left side of the wall lied a long, diamond-plated steel staircase down to the basement where the racks of shoe boxes resembled the warehouse from Raiders of the Lost Ark where "Top...Men..." were looking into the Ark of the Covenant.

Also down there amongst the racks was the manager's office, break room, coat room, two bathrooms, and the punch clock[1]. Every retail store back-room setup of that era had much the same setup. Except we had something special. A small sign on the wall of each bathroom. It's hardly fair to call them signs, since they were just two sheets of printer paper with three lines of text in 21 point Arial font. But those three lines are what set us apart.

| Big people talk about ideas.
| Average people talk about things.
| Small people talk about other people.

<!-- Notes for next time: Talk about how innocent that seems. Then talk about what it really means. Then talk about how that relates to the way the store was run. Then talk about how that relates to how we think about other people. Then talk about how that affects how we talk about other people when they're not around. Then talk about how worrying about how people talk about us is incorrect, because they aren't hurting us if we're not around to hear it. They're only hurting themselves. And by that token, so are we when we do the same. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
