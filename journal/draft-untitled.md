Let's talk about the unreliability of memory. 

But first, let's talk about debt. When I consider my finances, it's easy for me to believe I'm in good standing because I made good choices. This is because I do make good choices. But my good choices are a recent development, relatively speaking. If we liken the timeline of my finances to the timeline of planet Earth, my good choices have been around as long as humankind. (this is unclear, fix it - also, it's probably more like half and half, so adjust as necessary) 

Much of the first half of my money time was spent wasting it and building up avoidable self-inflicted credit card debt. Three things turned the tide: help from my parents, a car accident settlement, and my wife. The gist: in 2010, the combination of a car accident settlement (which afforded us the chance to wipe all debt clean if we wanted) and getting married (started a life of combined decision-making and financial responsibility) spelled the end of my debt. But now, 14 years later, I look in the mirror and unironially say "you, sir, are good with money." What a liar. I had nothing to do with it. Without my parents, wife, or a random car accident where a drug dealer was running from the cops and plowed his car through the intersection I was about to enter, I would just as easily still be up to my eyeballs in it. 

Why does my memory do this? What purpose does it serve?

<!-- Notes for tomorrow: Good luck turning this into anything -->

One day I woke up and I had no more debt. How long was I out? 

It started like most debt starts, with credit cards. Like many young morons, I bought nonsense things because I wanted them. 

My first card had a $2,500 limit. I was 18. I don't think I'm going to publish this, so let's just put the facts in:

How much debt did my parents help me clear?
- At LEAST 20K...
  - 10K was a personal loan I took out to pay down credit card debt. 
  - 10K for a new car when mine got stolen.
  - Probably another 5K in gifted money to give me breathing room

Car accident
- When I was about to get married, I still had $10k+ in owed debt - I don't remember how many was CC vs. personal loan
  - Settlement from a car accident in 2010 wiped the remaining debt clear

Help with home buying
- 30K towards the down payment? The IRS allowed 15K per donee in 2021.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
