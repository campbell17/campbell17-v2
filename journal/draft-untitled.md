Natural Life Enhancement

A few years ago, I traveled to Puerto Rico to be a groomsman at the wedding of one of my best friends. He made his brother best man, but in the months leading up to the wedding he hinted at the possibility of each of the other 4 groomsmen saying a few words of their own. So I prepared. I wrote a speech that was detailed yet brief, playful yet kind, and so witty even the 30% of the wedding patrons who didn't speak English would laugh. I practiced in my bedroom closet so my family wouldn't hear me talking to myself like a lunatic. In my mind, I killed, and I was eager to see if the reaction would match my expectations. In the weeks that followed, I ran through the delivery and timing in the back of my mind every few days to make sure I didn't clam up when my turn came.

The contents of the speech are centered around an idea I had about choosing the right friends. Specifically, "life enhancers". This is not to be confused with "natural male enhancers". They have pills for that. Or white rhino horns if you believe the stories about the illegal Asian aphrodisiac market. But I digress.

A life enhancer is someone who consistently add joy, laughter, experiences, or opportunities we wouldn't have otherwise encountered on our own. At some point we've all harnessed the hyperbole of the expression, "that took years off my life". Life enhancers do the opposite.

There are countless ways to accelerate our deaths. The activities we enjoy, our nutrition (or lack of it), and the company we keep all have different effects. Some act as rebar, bolstering our health and character, strengthening our foundation. Others are more like coarse grit sandpaper, stripping away the years with stress and conflict. We claim agency over our activities and nutrition, but I think sometimes we don't put enough stock in the company we keep. We spend our lives surrounded by others, but who are these people? Looking around at the entourage we've chosen, are these people rebar or sandpaper?

<!-- Notes for NEXT TIIIIMMMME (sing-songed like the narrator of a Hanna Barbara cartoon): Maybe add the people you admire part. Maybe add something about the skiing? Add the ending. -->



Ending: Oh, by the way, I never had to give the speech. My friend's brother gave his at the reception and it was concise and heartfelt. I think we groomsmen all decided it was plenty. So we all just clapped and kept eating and that was it. And then we danced. That wedding was killer.






- We've all heard some form of the expression, "that'll take years off your life." But what about the opposite?

- There are different ways to accelerate your death. The activities you practice, the fuel you choose to intake, and the company you keep all have different grit levels. The worse for your health, the coarser the grit, the more longevity it strips away.

- We have agency over our activities and fuel, but sometimes we don't put enough stock in the company we keep. We're surrounded, but who are these people? Do they strip away at your life or do they add to it?

- Become friends with people you admire in some specific way. If you can't manage that yet, add some distance to friends who make you look saintly by comparison. The adage "there's always someone better" is aimed at keeping us humble, but it should also be a reminder to surround ourselves with those very people. (Strike a balance, though, their 'betterness' should be just around the corner from yours...something attainable or at least aspirational and not so super-human you feel inferior when you spend time with them.)

- Likewise, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind of person who adds stress to others? (<--- strengthen the hell out of this)





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
