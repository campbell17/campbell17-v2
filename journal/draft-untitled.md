Pasted from last week:

<!-- Notes for below: He's never done something like this before. He doesn't play with tools. He doesn't build or fix things. He hasn't yet developed those curiosities about the physical world. But if he keeps doing nothing but gaming, in 10 years he will be miserable and he won't know how to operate in society. <-- this is the short version, make it less harsh and explain the upward nature of doing compared to the static nature of not doing. -->

Right now we're creeping our way toward the end of summer. In the futile hope of counteracting some of the gratuitous amounts of video games I've let my youngest son play, I assigned him a little project this week.

## The Mission

Let's talk about toilets. Specifically, the lid/seat arrangement of toilets. With the seat and lid fully down, the toilet is closed for business. You can sit on it to hide from that lecherous party guest, but that's about it. With the seat and lid fully up, the toilet is a standing room only venue. In between, however - lid up, but seat down, things can get challenging. When in standby mode, our lids are always fully closed. Somehow as a family we all agreed on that, which is a feat in itself. This means every time the boys step up to bat, part of our routine is reaching down to lift the lid and seat up.

I promise this is going somewhere.

One of our toilets, however, has a lid that overhangs the seat by just enough to take conscious effort to wedge your fingers under the seat to get them both skyward. 

<!-- This should be longer. 
Tell the story about the toilet seat but that's not the end. It's one piece. 
Expand on the differences between doing something right away and talking forever. -->



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
