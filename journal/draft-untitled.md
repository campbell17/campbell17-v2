"I think it was the nap that did it. I'm going to start napping between classes from now on."

Let me stop you right there before dousing your excitement with some good news and bad news. The good news is you were finally able to memorize some difficult material for one of your hardest classes. The bad news, backed by anyone who has ever tried and failed to implement a magic-bullet strategy, is:

The nap had nothing to do with it.

Yes, you took an hour nap (which is too long) between your morning and afternoon classes. Yes, you don't normally do this. Yes, your memory seemingly sprang into life after the nap, allowing you to recall some of the toughest subject matter you've faced this semester. But no...

The nap had nothing to do with it.

"So what was it, then?"

Well, let's look at some other single and totally irrelevant variables. _[NOTES: you had x for breakfast...you did y last night. You put your right shoe on first instead of your left, etc etc. think of funny examples of other ridiculously irrelevant things to put the nap into perspective as obviously NOT something that mattered]_

Maybe it was one (and surely ONLY one) of those?

How long did you say you've been working on memorizing this material?

"At least thirty minutes a day for three weeks."

And out of those 630 minutes of intense memorization, you think the 60 minutes of napping you crushed this morning was the skeleton key to unlock that treasure chest of knowledge?

"...maybe?"

Maybe you need _another_ nap.

This exchange highlights how unnatural it can be for our brains to isolate the correlation of our actions to an outcome. There are thousands of variables from which to choose and many more thousands we don't even know about going on behind the scenes. It's akin to the actions of a post-war cargo cult, building planes and Jeeps out of straw in hopes that the real planes containing supplies and advanced technology that arrived during World War II would return again.

Notes for next time: The subject matter doesn't matter. Trying to zero in on the minutiae of correlation is missing the point. Set yourself up in such a way that the subject matter could be literally anything, and the output would still be outstanding. What do I want the outcome to be? What prep have I discovered that I have confidence will achieve that regardless of other variables that come and go?



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But..., therefore...”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
