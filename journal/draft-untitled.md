A stranger used to stop us on the street. In a city of 1.5 million people, it may seem unlikely to encounter the same person twice, but there stood my friend and I, trying to figure out how we kept bumping into this guy we didn't know. It was our first year at college and our first time living in a city, but we knew enough to know it was weird. He didn't start a conversation mid-sentence, ask us for money, as us for help, or apologize for skipping over the whole "I know you don't know me and this is weird" part. He just walked up to us friendly as could be, said "hey guys!" like we were classmates, and asked us what we were up to. He then proceeded to tell us about what he was doing, remarked about how we should hang out, and attempted to barnacle his way onto whatever it was my friend and I were on our way to do. He was preppy and peppy and looked like he just stepped out of a Dockers ad from Golf Digest. We successfully fended him off with a vague, non-committal excuse and continued on our way. He seemed a fraction older than us. Maybe in his early twenties. He was too put together to peg as unhinged, but more forward than would be considered acceptable. The first time it happened, we laughed it off as the kind of thing that just happens walking around a city. But then it kept happening. Same guy, same routine, except now he had the advantage of recognition. Our amusement waned. Nothing ever escalated, and in fact he didn't stray from the formula the other three times he diverted us that year. One day, months after the final time, my friend and I walked past the spot from our first encounter and a brief "in memoriam" ensued. The winds of the universe must have shifted. We never saw him again.

Possible directions:
- This happens in cities but not in suburbia
- It's a numbers game, that guy probably had no idea he was weird and ended up finding friends. Or his murder victims.
- We didn't ask because we didn't want to know
- I was that guy when I asked a girl out cold in the hallway in highschool between classes. She didn't even know who I was.

I regret not asking him about himself that first time, but only out of latent curiosity. When the unexpected shows up at our door, our first instinct is to get rid of it as soon as possible before it steps over the threshold and starts rummaging around. Point being, the fewer things we knew about this guy, the better, lest he use our curiosity to lay claim to a relationship that doesn't exist. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
