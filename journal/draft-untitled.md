The online coaching sphere is an infitie Russian doll. 

- There's a problem with online coaching, and I'm trying to put my finger on it. 
- I used to work for a company that was scammy. I thought they were a web design agency since that's what their website said, but I didn't look closely enough. I was young and early in my career and just needed something to take the place of my failing freelance business. The website talked a lot about the company culture, but the red flag - which I clearly ignored - was no mention of any projects they worked on. No portfolio. What did they actually _do_ at this place? 
- I feel the same way whenever I encounter a supposed expert online coach. Someone who will teach me how to make money online by creating and selling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and sellling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and selling...sorry, will you excuse me for just a second? *GIF of Edward Norton punching himself in the face for the first time
- Can anyone spot the problem here? Not only to these people not really do anything, their entire business model is predicated on teaching you how to not really do anything either. Here's an online course on how to build an online course." For what, though? 
- I don't want to give off the impression that I think online coaching/instruction is a scam. Quite the opposite. Anyone in a creative field with the drive to improve and the curiosity to grow has a global knowledge base at their fingertips for a fraction of the cost of a traditional university. "So is all online coaching a scam? No."
- Who cares? People have been scamming since lying was invented. "Hey, did you happen take a bite from this apple?" "Umm, no." SCAMMED. (2 panel meme with adam and eve scene, SCAMMED over the god figure in the second panel. Seems verbose for a throwaway, but whatevs). I care. Because I loathe do-nothings. A do-nothing is the person that talks the most in the meeting, but can't actually do anything to put the plan into action. This is not to be confused with people who unapologetically do nothing and also keep their mouth shut about it. Those people I envy.
- But scammy online coaching is a cesspool of do-nothings.

Gonna redeploy this from personal Mac to fix build error...

Notes for next time: Explore why do-nothings suck so hard? This could be a direction to go.

I need to distinguish the cosmetic, surface level observations here from something more compelling. Dig deeper into why this is a problem and how it's even all that different from any other scam out there. 

Also, separate the do-nothings from the real McCoys, Draplins et al, who provide practical training. Training is different than productizing coaching. Being coached to be a coach is vapid unless you've already put in the mileage and are hoping to teach others what you know.

Also, differentiate between online coaching that's 1 level deep - therapy, organization, parenting, etc. These are teaching you practical techniques and skills to address specific problems, pains, and issues in your life. The level is 1, from coach to player. My problem is with coaching to coach. Unless you're Peyton Manning giving a seminar on how to be an actual football coach, which as you can see is the 1 level deep type, you're doing it wrong.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
