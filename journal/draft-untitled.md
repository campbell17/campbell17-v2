Well shit. I didn't pick a topic AND I didn't write an outline.

Maybe this one: Expectations.

- Sebastian came out and was 15 feet away from my car. Didn't see me.
- Our expectations have a strangle hold on our emotions.
- When the expected misaligns with reality, chemicals flood your brain. Which ones? Hell if I know. But chaos is happening in there.
- Especially tough on children, but adult children don't fare much better.

Notes: continue outline, find more personal examples, find the outcome, find the surprise.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
