- There's a pattern of behavior that causes people to try very hard, with earnest intention and intense motivation, and just when they get pretty good at whatever they're trying, they stop improving. The resistance that comes along with the final 20% of improvement is so thick that it is far more comfortable to tread water at 80% (or even 60%) than grab for that next gear and grind their way into excellence.
- I'm a huge proponent of "good enough". My entire life is so saturated with _good enough_, I'm considering commissioning a half-finished statue with no upper body adorned with that phrase on the placard. Of course, people have varying standards of what constitutes a passable level of aptitude. For instance, I wouldn't want my heart surgeon to subscribe to my good enough lifestyle, but it works just fine for a golfing buddy. There are some aspects of my circle of competence, though, where good enough just isn't.
