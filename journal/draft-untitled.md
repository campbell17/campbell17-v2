<!-- "Waiting on my wife." -->
"That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?"
"Half."
"What else then?"
"Just lookin' for what's comin'."
"Yeah, but no one ever sees that."

I realized recently my youngest child is growing beyond my control. This isn't to say he's _out of_ control. He's kind-hearted. And though he has big emotions, he's not wild by any means. But my ability to influence how he is, what he does, and how he "turns out" is entering a phase of diminishing returns. I'll explain how it dawned on me.

We were in the midst of our middle-school morning routine: He sleeps through his alarm so I get him up. He forgets to brush his teeth so I remind him. But other than that, I've been feeling redundant. The one alarm he does obey tells him when to leave for the bus stop and I usually head downstairs to give him a goodbye hug and see him out. But it occurred to me that maybe he doesn't need me to shut the door behind him. Maybe that gesture alone is enough to rob him of a slice of independence he could otherwise enjoy - being fully in charge of getting himself ready and leaving the house. I wasn't sure if he liked my company in the morning or if he'd rather I bugger off. I tried deducing the answer from his body language, but he wasn't giving up the goods. He seemed fine with whatever I did. Maybe he didn't have a preference. In the end, I did the unimaginable. Something so bold - brazen even - as to risk throwing my years of impeccable parenting into disarray.

I asked _him_.

I presented two options because leaving this open-ended would return the infamous shrug-of-undetermined-resolution. Option 1 includes me milling around downstairs while he gets ready, then offering a quick hug before saying goodbye and closing the door behind him. In option 2, I go back upstairs to my office door and leave him to it, letting him come say goodbye when he's ready, i.e., he's in charge of everything. He chose the latter.

Satisfied, if not unsurprised with his choice, I turned to walk away. But I only made it three steps before something stopped me. There had to be more to this.

I live at the extremes of a bell curve with my youngest. One moment I'm checking on him for the 5th time about whether or not he remembered to set his phone alarm for screen time, and then next I'm secretly hoping he asks me to ride his bike alone into town, knowing he'd have to cross over a highway interchange on the way. One side of my face is telling my wife he's fine walking home in the dark while the other asks him how he's doing every hour like the annoying beep of a smoke alarm that needs new batteries.

When I was a kid, having both parents working from home was a rarity. And by rarity, I mean the phrase "work from home" didn't exist yet. If we were lucky, the earliest we got to see our dad was 6:00pm when he got back from work. I lament the fact that my kids never got to experience the horror of hearing the garage door opening in the evening, knowing they were about to answer for the unspeakable crimes they put their mother through while I was at work. 

But unlike my dad, and other dads of the pre-internet era, every day since my son's birth I've spent hours (emphasis on the plural) in his presence. The winds shifted months ago when he began making himself scarce on most days, but I didn't catch on until now. Having two older kids, I'm familiar with this change in temperature. From partner in crime to glorified chauffeur. In a way, this is both liberating and satisfying. I feel like he's taking the reigns of his own life and won't need me quite as much. But with that comes a terrifying question from my inner monologue:

"Have I done enough?"

I always rattle on about our nature being the dominant driver of our behavior, forcing nurture to ride in the back with zero leg room. So I've tried over the years to tailor my parenting to suit each child's temperament so we would gel as a unit rather than grinding each other down in opposition. At least that's what I'd like to believe. The truth is probably closer to seat-of-the-pants parenting for the first two kids and overcorrecting to make up for all my mistakes with the third. I wouldn't go so far as to admit to helicopter parenting, but who would? "Present and avaiable". That's me.





Hygene. Brushed teeth and deodorized pits. Every morning I would ask, and every morning they weren't done yet. Even when I waited until he had one foot out the door, they still weren't done.

I circled back to ask him what the solution to this, the actual root of the behavior could be. He offered the suggestion of writing a sticky note and leaving it in a promenent place, but as prior trials of this had flamed out quickly, I was reluctant to try again.

Another idea was setting an alarm on his phone, which works for some things but not others. Also, if he's occupied at the time the alarm goes off, it loses all effect.

However, one thing he does reliably do, is empty the dishwasher. As long as he wakes up on time, I don't have to remind him. This is all we need.

Now we can ride the coattails of an existing habit.

Emptying the dishwasher has a great 3-act structure: Act one, the door opens an lowers to the floor. Act two, the dishes are removed and put where they belong. Act three, the door is lifted to a close. Curtain down.

Chris whatshisface negotiator says he heard from the blue angels or someone (find source and clean up) that it takes 67 repetitions for something to become muscle memory. My experiment, agreed upon and co-opted by my youngest, is to patch his hygene routine into the act of opening the dishwasher door. He's already doing that part on his own, so I said "let's have you open the door, then immediately go upstairs to brush your teeth and deodorize, then you can come back down and, seeing the door still open, resume the routine already ingrained in muscle memory. (too wordy, clean up)

Now I can (more) safely step back and let him breathe.





Notes for tomorrow: This turned away from a post about losing control and into one about just asking. 

For years I've been practicing to loosen my grip, but I feel like I didn't practice hard enough.

It's time to let go. What's comin' is already here.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
