Well shit. I didn't pick a topic AND I didn't write an outline.

Maybe this one: Expectations.

- Sebastian came out and was 15 feet away from my car. Didn't see me.
- Our expectations have a strangle hold on our emotions.
- When the expected misaligns with reality, chemicals flood your brain. Which ones? Hell if I know. But chaos is happening in there.
- Especially tough on children, but adult children don't fare much better.
- Look at the scale of expectations: Low, Realistic, High
- Low == almost anything qualifies as passing. Easy to feel positive about the outcome.
- Realistic == playing the odds, unlike low, failsafes are needed to redirect/correct "underperformance"
- High == nothing likely to be good enough. Useful if working towards something in my control, harmful if relying on others to meet criteria
- Entitlement plays a part if others' actions are required
- Get really good at calibrating expectations for the desired outcome
- Recent example: Dinner at Catherines: never been, chosen by people who don't pinch pennies, reason for going = celebration of a new job. Expectations: enjoy some killer food, good conversation with friends, gonna be pricey. Reality: Anxiety showed up a bit, but sitting outside helped settle it and good conversation cured it. Food = met, friends = 1 unexpected addition, added to the experience so outcome was positive, price = cost more than even anticipated. Ferrari in the parking lot. Oops. ouch. But tempered by the special occasion. Overall: outcome was highly positive.

- Should I architect the whole essay around the dinner? Maybe set up 1 pretend set of expecations that went unmet (leading to a miserable evening) and juxtapose it against the actual expectations that led to a pleasant one? Same dinner, same people, same place. but different emotional outcome?

Notes: work on structure, tie in idea of blind spots?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
