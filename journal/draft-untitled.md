"I think it was the nap that did it. I'm going to start napping between classes from now on."

Let me stop you right there before dousing your excitement with some good news and bad news. The good news is you were finally able to memorize some difficult material for one of your hardest classes. The bad news, backed by anyone who has ever tried and failed to implement a magic-bullet strategy, is:

The nap had nothing to do with it.

Yes, you took an hour nap (which is too long) between your morning and afternoon classes. Yes, you don't normally do this. Yes, your memory seemingly sprang into life after the nap, allowing you to recall some of the toughest subject matter you've faced this semester. But no...

The nap had nothing to do with it.

"So what was it, then?"

Well, let's look at some other single and totally irrelevant variables. _[NOTES: you had x for breakfast...you did y last night. You put your right shoe on first instead of your left, etc etc. think of funny examples of other ridiculously irrelevant things to put the nap into perspective as obviously NOT something that mattered]_

Maybe it was one (and surely ONLY one) of those?

How long did you say you've been working on memorizing this material?

"At least thirty minutes a day for three weeks."

And out of those 630 minutes of intense memorization, you think the 60 minutes of napping you crushed this morning was the skeleton key to unlock that treasure chest of knowledge?

"...maybe?"

Maybe you need _another_ nap.

This exchange highlights how unnatural it can be for our brains to isolate the correlation of our actions to an outcome. There are thousands of variables from which to choose and many more thousands we don't even know about going on behind the scenes. It's akin to the actions of a post-war cargo cult, building planes and Jeeps out of straw in hopes that the real planes containing supplies and advanced technology that arrived during World War II would return again. Luckily for humankind, however, we devised empirical methods of gathering knowledge that focus on open-eyed scrutiny and testing of our assumptions. Unfortunately, that shit takes time and most humans are impatient. 

When something finally clicked for our napping student, why did he immediately skip over all the hard work as the probable cause? Well, which would I rather do? Spend ten hours doing rote memorization or take one long ass nap? When it comes to determining the correlation between action and progress, I'd be hard-pressed to find a metric better than Time Spent _Doing_. And I don't mean talking about doing or thinking about doing, I mean actually doing. If I run a software company and my engineers spend more time in meetings than in the code, our progress will tank. Trying to zero in on the minutiae of correlation is missing the point if I'm not dedicating enough time to the subject in the first place.

When I started this Substack, I set aside the same time every day to write so I could always ship a new essay at the end of the week. I was terrified at first because I was only making an educated guess on a what a successful routine looked like. In the beginning, I was overindexing on the subject matter of the essays, thinking the topic had to be perfect to me to be motivated to write. After a few, I got a feel for what milestones I needed to hit along the way to avoid last-minute panic on shipping day and eventually I felt confident enough in the process that the subject matter didn't matter. I know if I pick a topic on Monday and start an outline, the rest will fall into place as the days tick away. It remind me of asking a filmmaker to tell a compelling visual story about getting the mail. The mileage they put in allowed them to sculpt a routine that will provide a successful outcome, regardless of the subject matter.

So the next time my kids come to me with tall tales of their magic bullets, I'll remind them of the thirty minutes they set aside every day and reiterate: "The nap had nothing to do with it."

Notes for next time: Polish, add the funny stuff above


There's a school of thought promoting the benefits of "focused" practice over simple repetition and while I agree in principle, there's often a subtext of "otherwise don't bother" which I can't abide. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But..., therefore...”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
