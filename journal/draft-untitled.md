I like's it smooooth.

<!-- Stick figure drawing of dude up against wavy lines he can't traverse, can't get to the other side where it's smooth and he can continue making progress. -->

Note: make a series of drawings to illustrate the stages of progress.

It's no secret I love lists. Lists are fantastic. They keep things in front of me instead of behind me. They keep things visible. But there's a catch. Every time I make a list of stuff to do, I introduce handfuls of wavy lines into my smooth, unobstructed timeline. But it's not the list itself, is it? The list is just a record of the stuff. It's the stuff. The todos. Those goddamn todos. I imagine this problem only afflicts those industrious types like us who always want to feel useful, so if you're a garden slug or couch sloth you can skip ahead I guess. Come to think of it, what are you doing here? Beat it.

Our personal timeline begins as a flat, level path. If we experienced nothing our entire lives, the line would remain at level zero until we died of old age, natural disaster, or boredom. But we don't experience nothing. Instead, we make plans. When a plan executes, our timeline elevates slightly. That's growth. We want to get from our current level to whatever level the next experience grants us. Each experience represents a different amount of growth, but we're not allowed to raise the level of our timeline until we build a ramp of todos from the current line to the next. To do that, we have to compile a list of todos commensurate with the plan at hand. However, each todo is a jagged line we can't get around until the task it represents is complete. When we check the box, the line forms a tiny section of the ramp and only then can we proceed. Up and up we go as we complete our todos until the final section of the ramp connects. Now the path we walk is higher than it was before, but now it levels off until we find a new experience to plan.



Notes for next time: What happens when you leave todos undone? Describe this, then encourage smootheness and finish the drawings and finish the essay.

Damn, son, who taught you how to keep your mind so focused? Can you teach me? In that case, share it with someone who enjoys stuff like this. _Whatever it is "this" is_.

Last Week's Photo

This is my sister. I could be pedantic and clarify this is not, in fact, my sister, but merely a photographic representation of my sister. But I won't do that to you. Not now. Not after all we've been through. Anyway, last week's essay was about breaking glass, but rather than take a hammer to my office window at 6am, I decided I'd get by with something a little more intact. A quick perusal of my surroundings produced this picture frame with the convenient feature of easy glass removal. So I borrowed my sister from her station below my (link to essay from campbell17)[every day calendar], slid the glass out about an inch, and Bob's yer uncle. I don't know what that means, but I do love saying it. I'll never Google it and whatever you do, don't tell me in the comments. It'll ruin the mystery.

Future Topics I'm Thinking About Thinking About

Timing: (<Seinfeld>) What's the deal with timing? (</Seinfeld>) The three best things in my life are all a result of great timing. I'm not that good, so am I just that lucky?

Big Ass Trees: There's something about living amongst 100ft trees that helps supply perspective on what doesn't matter. i.e, these things have been here a century or more. They're still keeping on. Things are probably gonna be ok.

Doing Things a Second Time: Getting my second publication ((Link to FormulaOnederful)[Formula Onederful]) off the ground was an order of magnitude faster than my first. Let's explore why.





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
