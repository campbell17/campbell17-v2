It was a bad idea softened only by the ___________ (timidness) of its execution. The journey would be less than a mile. We're both young. We're both incredibly lazy. I know I don't have my license yet, but I bet I could make it there and back without anyone noticing. It's a back road, so there's no traffic. What do you think?

Let's go.

I wish I could have been in the car when my parents, just returning from a trip to Boston, pulled into our street behind the car pulling out of our driveway.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
