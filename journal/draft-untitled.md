For this essay, lean hard on the setting. Make this a time and place people to which people want to return.

Summer friends. Sleeping over at the twin brothers' house. 

They were twins, though opposite in every way, visually. One wore his hat high in the back and pitched down with the brim low over his eyes. The other had his brim sticking straight up so high you could read the Gettysburg address on it from 10 feet away. He was tall and slender and looked like the type of kid who went fishing a lot. His brother was like a fireplug and somehow at age 12 already had the posture and confidence of a state trooper leaning against your car window. I met them playing travel baseball in Wexford. 

Their house was in a rural part of town, where the lawns were wide open so the grass always got scorched in summer. And it was definitely summer. I could see the haze rising from the road when I looked across their front yard and no matter how hard I squinted, I was all but blind when we paused our whiffle ball game and went inside for lunch. 

Notes: This is all about setting. Get as descriptive as possible and try to remember.

(Not sure where this goes, yet:) I don't even remember their names.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Make a ‘note’ that inspires others to ‘note it again.’ (- Tara McMullen: https://www.whatworks.fyi/p/what-can-i-do-to-grow-my-audience) In other words, make this essay REMARKABLE.
