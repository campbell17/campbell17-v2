Self Imposed Tragedy

Tragedy is not making the wrong choice. Tragedy is the moment you recognize you made the wrong choice.

I witnessed my first tragedy when I was about 6. I'd seen bad things happen before then, like when my mom dropped and broke her favorite tea mug coming down the stairs when I was 3, but that wasn't a tragedy, as such. She didn't choose to let the mug slip from her fingers.

When I was about six, we went on a vacation. We went to a gloomy wharf, stood on a rickety dock, and prepared to fish. There was a man already there doing some fishing of his own. He caught one. Watching him pull a living thing out of the water and onto the dock was gripping for me. He knelt down as if he was about to administer CPR on the mackerel, and took out his pocket knife. Now there were two things laying at the edge of the dock: a suffocating fish, and his knife. He arranged his patient to get a better angle to remove the hook, and as he pulled his hands away the fish lurched violently toward the water, bumping his knife in the process. Two objects once inert were now both in motion toward the same patch of water, and our kneeling friend had a choice to make. The law of loss aversion states that any current thing is the most important thing in the galaxy, so the knife never stood a chance. As he placed both hands on the sliding fish, his knife gave him a wink, thanked the rest of us for coming, and performed a backward two-and-a-half-somersault pike into the murky deep. It was breathtaking.

As the applause died down, I looked at the man and saw in his face the recognition of the consequence of his choice. That solitary moment of awareness is where tragedy lives. Determining how cruel the tragedy was would depend on his demeanor in the 5 seconds after this moment. It's conceivable this moment isn't a tragedy at all. That the knife was just some cheapie he bought at the dollar store on the way to the wharf because he forgot his good knife at home. But it's also possible this knife was a gift from his grandfather, who despite encouraging the man to use it often and not be too precious about it, imbued it with a deep sentimental value that recently intensified when he passed away. This would make the knife irreplaceable and the tragedy all but catastrophic.

As far as I could tell, the man's reaction was closer to the former. He admitted to reaching for the wrong object, but fell short of shedding any tears over it. I guess he keeps grandpa's knife on the shelf, in front of a diptych of photos taken of him during WWII.





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
