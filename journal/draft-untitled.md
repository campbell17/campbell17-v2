I had the dream again. The dream where I can't find the place to set up. I put the ball on the tee, I go to take my stance, but I can't. There's a bump under my foot. There's a stone in the way. There's too much uneven ground. But last night, the sport changed. This time instead of getting ready to tee off, I was propping a football under a stick to hold it upright while I kicked a field goal. Same shit, different sport. I set it up, it won't stay balanced. I get it balanced, the edge of the fence is in the way. Why is there a fence on the field? Why am I kicking towards a house intead of a goalpost?

I put close to zero stock into analyzing dreams. They're too open to interpretation, and any quack with a minor in psychology is happy to fill in the blanks, but they don't fucking know.

Notes for next time: this was mostly to remember because I think it's funny the sport changed. I did just get finished watching games yesterday, but this is definitely fear of failure-to-launch territory.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
