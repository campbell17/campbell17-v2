Doing Something For the Second Time.

You'd think after 40+ years of doing stuff for the first time, the list of stuff would begin to shrink. But nearly every week, I come out of a ____ and discover I'm neck-deep in some new task I've never had a reason to complete before. 

The other day I replaced the rim on an outdoor basketball hoop. One of the nubbins that holds the net broke off two years ago and when I finally decided to remove the rim to solder it back on, I discovered the nut rusted and frozen on the retaining bolt. No amount of PB Blaster™ cracked the code, so I had no choice but to cut the bolt head off with an angle grinder (also a first). A few days before that, I used a woodworking router for the first time. I needed the router to finish off the first piece of furniture I ever made, an oversized shoe bench for our entryway. A few days before that, I was up to my shoulders in fender metal in my first ever attempt to replace the passenger-side inner tie rod on my wife's 2012 Mazda that recently developed a knocking sound in the suspension. I haven't been bored in years.

There's terror in trying new things. I think it varies in severity depending on the person. But I've found the terror getting quieter over the years the more new things I take on. I still have all my appendages, I haven't burned any houses down yet, and the wheels haven't come off any family members' cars on their way to the clandestine meetings they attend behind my back. Ok, full disclosure, one time my oldest son called me about a brake caliper bolt falling out and slamming against the inside of his rim. I swear I torqued those down properly. But I drove out there with a new bolt and saved the day. Never mind I was the reason he needed saving. As I try more new things, the voices in my head predicting I'll screw it up carry less weight. 

Doing something for the second time is a

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
