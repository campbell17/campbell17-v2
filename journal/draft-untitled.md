Terms and Conditions

There is always a cost. There is no such thing as a benefit without a cost. While benefit is annoyingly optional, cost is gravity, death, and taxes. Not optional. Want to cut loose and get ripped with your friends Friday night? Cool. In a few hours, you'll be on the bathroom floor wishing you were dead. This is the cost. Want to (think of another good example)? Nice. (Write out the cost.) This is the cost. (now do a third one).

The other day, my two oldest kids began peppering me with texts about upgrading their phones. They fell victim to the classic modern mobile plan gimmick, "Upgrade every year on us!". Without even looking into it, I assured them this was not free. "But the marketing wank said blah blah", they persisted. As they tapped those rhetorts into their still-basically-brand-new-and-fully-working phones, I was already on the carrier's website looking for the fine print. And fine print I found. The asterisk. The most diabolical symbol in the punctuation library. It tells you everything you need to know about something without the need to see another letter. It's a beacon of reassurance that we can disregard every word prepended to it with extreme prejudice.

Something about my kids thinking they could upgrade their phones for free because the mobile advertising always talks about "upgrade every year". Yes, they allow you to upgrade, but all that means is they'll take your old phone and give you a pittance toward another phone, meaning you're still out of pocket hundreds.

Something I didn't expect about getting older is my growing intuition regarding tradeoffs. When I was younger, I still maintained the naive belief that the concept of free was real. (cut from "I don't love it")

- This initial skepticism opens up more opportunity to be pleasantly surprised when something _is_ actually a "good deal"




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
