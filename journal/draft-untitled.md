There are times when I'm convinced that life isn't that hard. You get enough sleep, eat decent food, pay the bills on time, show up when and where you're needed...easy, right? And what happens when you cross paths with something unexpected? Sometimes the unexpected is delightful and spontaneous. But I'm not talking about that. What happens when you cross paths with something you didn't want?

In practical terms, you deal with it as needed, evaluate why it happened, and set systems in place to prevent its reoccurance.

Fine.

But what if that kept happening? What if it happened consistently. It wouldn't even have to be every day. Once a week might be enough. Would life seem like it "isn't that hard" then?

Maybe it's your fault. Bad attitude. Resistant to change. Full of blindspots and gaining more every day.

But what if it isn't? Is it merely a problem of perception? And if so, which things are being perceived inaccurately? Maybe you think your attitude is great, but you rub others the wrong way and always have. Or maybe you catastrophize the small hiccups most people perceive as one of the many costs of living life.

Notes: what am I trying to get at? 
- There are people who relish the challenge. Life is hard. But they're driven to win anyway.
- There are people who are barely surviving. Life is hard, but survival is all they know, so they don't know how hard it really is.
- There are people who get what they need and make good choices. Not because of chance, but because that's where they aim.
- There are people who get what they need but squander it with bad choices. 

- What is this categorization doing for this piece? Why does this matter/why is this worth bringing up?
- The word futility is the reason I started writing this. The futility I felt when out of desperation I threatened Sebastian with a 1 year video game ban. I kept talking through it with him and left the door open for an alternative, thank god. But there is nothing I can conjure that can make him not only understand what he can't do and why, but also impart the ability to act on that knowledge, i.e., NOT act on his impulses.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
