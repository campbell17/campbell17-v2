Timing.

"Red flannel. One o'clock...That dude's a boxer. See him?" He leans to his left toward his friend and covertly points at the seats in front of the stage.

"Oh, totally. Bump elbows with him on the way out, 'We got a problem, bud?!' No, sir, sorry sir."

"Ha! Yeah, immediate fetal position. No thanks. Oh, look at those two. A match made in heaven...wait, they got wrist bands, what are those for?"

"Huh. For the alcohol, maybe? Did Charlotte get one?"

"No, and she got the...what did you order, baby?" He turns to his right and gently pats his wife's arm to get her attention.

"White wine," Charlotte replies. "I was going to get red but they only had Merlot so I got the white."

"White wine," he says, turning back to his friend. "Sweet sippy cup, though."

Unfamiliar hip-hop music continues to play in the background as more people file in.

"Her man's having trouble with his band." 

They both look over to study the large man with large wrists struggling mightily to affix his $0.07 Tyvek wrist band in a way that won't tear out a patch of arm hair when he removes it after the show.

"Help out your boy," the friend says, telepathically encouraging the man's girlfriend to intervene.

"There she goes. She finally noticed," he said. "It's a good thing the show is here and not at the Miller."

"Hmm?" Said the friend.

"We went to a show there a few months ago. That theater has tiny seats. I'm not sure that guy would fit. _We_ barely fit. Were people smaller a hundred years ago?"

"Is that how old it is?" asked the friend.

"I think so. Let's look it up," he pulls out his phone. "Welp, there goes that theory."

"No good?"

"Well, I was right about the Miller, but I assumed this theater was newer because the seats are big and plush. But this one is fifty years older."

With that mystery settled, the people-waiting continues.

notes for next time: roll this into the topic. Good luck.

- We went to a comedy show the other night in the city. While we were waiting for the opener to take the stage, I turned to my friend and asked if he ever thought about what it would be like to be one of these other bags of organs filing in.
- I'm not a "city person" but I lived in one for seven years during college. Most of the people at the show appeared to still be city people.
- On the infrequent times I go out in public, I sometimes look around and wonder what life would be like as the other people milling around.
- The timing of my circumstances feels unbelievable to me when I consider how fragile are the underpinnings of life. <!-- ugh, fix this -->
- The routines we undertake are supposed to buttress our lives with guardrails so we avoid making the wrong choice when we get to each fork. But there are countless dependencies at play, the timing of which are critical (use a better word).
- Any tiny ripple in the timing can be the difference between two completely different lives.

<!-- Notes for next time -->
My timing: 
1. I left the city
2. I met my wife
3. I got cold-called for this job

- What if I never left the city?
- What if I didn't pursue my wife?
- What if I didn't answer the phone?

So why did I leave?
Why did I try harder to pursue her?
Why did I answer the phone and take the call seriously?

I'm not that good. But I'm also not that lucky.
They say luck is preparation plus opportunity.
What did my preparation look like?
How did I train myself, in my own blind way, to recognize an opportunity?
How did I know what I wanted? Did I?

I knew I wanted a creative career. After the shroud of entitlement I earned in college, the spell wears off and I realize ANYTHING adjacent to what I thought I would be when I grew up would suffice.
So when I got the call to do something that wasn't even on my radar, I knew it was close enough. This is the way in. I don't even know where IN is, but this is the way.

I knew I wanted a family. After ending a long term relationship, I understood to some degree what was missing, so I knew better what to look for. Some of the ideals I thought were important in a partner became immensely unimportant when contrasted with the core values I built up from experience. It's like finding a new place to live and thinking the first thing you'll do when you move in is get rid of those ugly light fixtures. 12 years later, you realize you never even looked at them once you moved in and instead had your attention on all the important things.

I knew I wanted to work with a better group of people. I have a creative career. Yay. But the people outside my immediate professional circle were continually causing me stress (write this part better). I understood that there was a difference between a healthy team and a dysfunctional one. I didn't know exactly what a healthy team looked like, but I'd seen enough dysfunction to know I was ready to try something else to find out. My eyes were peeled and my ears were open, so when the phone call came, my frame of mind was ready recognize that though this may not be the way into a healthy team, at least it was a way out of the current one. The grass is always greener, but sometimes it stays that way.

So as I look at the people coming in and taking their seats, it reminds me how different things could have been...

<!-- How to end this thing - does anyone give a shit that things are working out? How fucking boring are you, man? (hint: figure out a compelling way to tie all this to something anyone might have a slight chance of giving a shit about) -->


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
