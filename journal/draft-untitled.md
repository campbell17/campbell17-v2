Beware of adults who can't give you a straight answer.

I wrote the preceding sentence, sat with it for a moment, then immediately revised it. I replaced the word "those" with the word "adults". It's an important distinction I don't want to gloss over. Because if you or someone you love has kids over the age of 5, you know there's no such thing as a straight answer with kids. I've asked the most bone stock, two-plus-two, "do you know your own name" level of yes/no question and received seizure-inducing stammering in return.

But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about adults. I could push it as far as young adults, depending on their maturity levels, but at that point it could still go either way.

Bewware of (is the OF here wrong? Check it and update the other one) adults who can't give you a straight answer.

<!-- Notes for next time: start by establishing what this actually means. What does a not-straight answer look like. Start with what the opposite of straight is: crooked. Then talk about the patterns of speech of people who do this. Think people who come on financial audit. How much do you make per month? "Well, it depends..." It always depends. I agree in many cases "it depends" is the correct answer, but not to a math question. And adults who give crooked answers stink at math. -->

Thoughts On Relationships
The structures, the pillars, and the prize for the work.

When we begin a relationship, we're assigned two structures: A pyramid and a Jenga tower. Every act, experience, conversation, argument, win, and loss, counts for a number of blocks.

When we behave as a team, honestly, earnestly, and with the strength of the relationship in mind, we add a layer of structure to the pyramid. It gets stronger. It grows. We grow. 

If however, we're sneaky, shady, dishonest, disingenuous, selfish, or otherwise acting as an individual and solely in our best interest, we remove a block from the Jenga tower.

Each structure is affected by different forces. The pyramid is subject to the winds, storms, pushes, and pulls of the outside world. It needs to be big enough to maintain its form so it doesn't get swallowed up by the tragedies of life we all must endure. Therefore, our behavior has an additive effect. As we aim toward the good and behave in accordance with it, the layers add up. The Jenga tower is different. This structure is finite. Its blocks are in limited supply and are irreplaceable. When we begin a new relationship, we start from a complete tower. It's as stable as it will ever be. When we act without integrity, either with dishonesty or without the union's best interests in mind, we remove some blocks. The number of blocks removed depends on the nature and severity of the offense. Getting caught in a white lie can cost us a block. Getting caught cheating can (and probably should) topple the entire structure.

When this happens, it's game over. We only get one Jenga tower and it has to remain standing for the relationship to continue. I've heard of cases where a tower-toppling act isn't the end, but this just means the entire relationship and both its structures were torn down and a new ground floor was established under a new set of rules and a mutual understanding. And both parties usually aren't willing to start from zero with the same person who razed the structures in the first place (find a different word for razed and structures?).

THURSDAY

Some relationships are destined to fail. "Speak now or forever hold your peace" (piece? I've never thought about which one it is...) _exists_ because some relationships are destined to fail. Because some people simply aren't right for each other. An impenetrable pyramid is only achievable for relationships containing all three pillars of importance: attraction, compatibility, and chemistry. 

Attraction is simple. It means you love to look at them. Have you ever met someone who repulses you, making it impossible to even look their way without visceral internal heaving? Attraction is the opposite of that. Attraction means, if only it were socially acceptable, you would stare for long stretches without averting your eyes. 

Compatibility is more cerebral. Compatibility is the likelihood you'll be on the same page about important life decisions. Personal politics, as an example, is _not_ an important life decision. Important decisions include, but are not limited to: whether or not to have children, how to raise said children, where to live (location and domecile type), where and how to save and spend money, and so on. Each of those examples could be unpacked into hundreds of micro-examples, but for the sake of brevity I'll assume the gist is clear.

Finally, if compatibility is viewed through the lens of one's head, chemistry is what lies in one's heart. Effortless flirtation is a decent start, but it's more than that. Chemistry is as the name suggests: chemical. Like attraction, it's not something we can choose. I would describe it as oneness. It's a measure of the level of ease a couple has with each other. If standing in a crowded elevator, how close is too close for a couple who's chemistry is maxed out? The correct answer is, there's no such thing as too close. 

Those who find themselves in a relationship that has a healthy amount of all three pillars have the chance to build a pyramid impervious to destruction. The opposite is true for those who are lacking in one or more pillars. Those unfortunates are sitting on a ticking time bomb, whether they realize it or not. Right now, there's a person walking the streets of some city in which they've never set foot who checks all three boxes, a fact that will dominate the front of their minds in the event they actually meet. 

These odds depend on how many new people come into our lives. I believe there are hundreds if not thousands of perfect matches roaming the earth for every person, but if I'm a hermit and never leave my house, or worse, an introvert, my chances of meeting one of "the ones" shrinks greatly.

But meeting the right person isn't the end of the job. It's the beginning. Then there's the matter of putting in the work to preserve your tower while team-building up your pyramid. We may sometimes feel compelled to adopt a facade early in a relationship to shield it from our obvious and yet-to-be-discovered inadequacies. This is a critical mistake, not least of which because it establishes an icy foundation of dishonesty right from the outset. Pyramid building is an iterative process, requiring constant maintenance, tweaking, and fiddling. We're extinguishing tiny fires and slaying tiny dragons every day as we make and correct our mistakes and burn off all the dead wood of baggage and bad habits we brought along with us. Unaddressed problems are dragons hiding under the rug, growing in size in obscurity. When we hide who we truly are early on, that's an act we can't sustain indefinitely. Every flaw and personality quirk we bury robs our partner of the opportunity to see and either accept, modify, or eradicate it for the betterment of the relationship. It's like dropping a fastener into the Mars rover assembly 3 months into its 2 year construction and not telling anyone until JPL is about to ship the whole works to Cape Canaveral for launch. If I raised my hand when I dropped it, a supervisor can evaluate the situation and we can fix the problem and continue. If I raise my hand now, the entire mission gets scrubbed and costs us 3 billion dollars. Some people never raise their hand at all, resulting in some catastrophic failure and the cancellation of the entire space program. But I digress...

The point of being your true self from the very start is to weed out the people we aren't meant to be with as quickly as possible. If I'm a slob, and I know I'm a slob, and I have no intention of ever _not_ being a slob, rather than hide it from someone I'm dating, I should let it all hang out. There is zero downside. If my partner is repulsed and wants me to change, I can find out immediately it's not going to work out. Or, and this is the aim, I meet someone who not only makes me _want_ to clean up my act, but is successful in getting me to actually do so. Maybe the success is only honing some rough edges and I still leave laundry on the floor sometimes. But maybe that's good enough for them, and they're happy to see the change. Or maybe I meet a fellow slob and we're blissful in our filth. Having shown my true nature, the options are out in the open, waiting for us to act on them. If I hide who I am, our pyramid will get built under faulty foundations and has the possibility of imploding when the truth finally does come out. And it will.

FRIDAY

So given we found a person to whom we're attracted, compatible, and chemically in sync, and given we're both living as our true selves as much as we can, we have the opportunity to build the kind of pyramid that cannot be cracked. And the good habits we develop to achieve this multiply its strength, turning every positive experience into a bonding event and every crisis into a fortifying victory over adversity.

It's probably a little late to mention this, but none of this matters without full committment to seeing this relationship through until one of you crosses over the great divide. The effort it takes to attack every problem like it's a snake trying to enter your house is not something most of us will put forth unless we've _decided_ this is the only person for us. This is why it's so important to be with someone who is all three pillars for you, and you for them. When this happens, and you work as a team, you become a fortress. Your hard work together molds each of you into better versions of yourselves, completely customized for only each other. After a few years, when done right, there's literally no one better.

Along with committment, the other hard requirement to have a chance at success is communication. Everyone always says that. You have to communicate. No one will ever know what we think or how we feel unless we tell them. But it's not enough to just spout off. Every want, need, issue, problem, and plan should be communicated with a future-looking approach. Something as simple as who does the dishes and when needs its own mutual agreement. This is where the hard work of "it's a lot of hard work" lives. It gets tiresome to have to spend time working out every detail, but true romance is unromantic. Players on good teams all know what their job is. Players on elite teams know what their job is and what everyone else's job is. It's a self-correcting system. If one piece breaks down consistently, it means there's an imbalance in the plan and it needs reworking. And this requires honest, impartial, unemotional communication. Honesty is easy. Impartiality and lack of emotion is more aspirational. At least one member of the team needs to keep a cool head when emotions are running high to avoid massive escalation. Consitently bringing the conversation back to a future-looking place helps tamp down the resentments of right now and elevates the topic-at-hand - fixing the problem - back to the forefront. It might go something like this: 

(after an emotional exchange, but before escalation) "Ok, let's step back a moment and figure this out so it works for both of us moving forward."

At first, this style of communicating takes a leap of faith that things can be put back on the rails even as they're going sideways. As long as one person can stay cool long enough for the other to compose themselves, which is sometimes easier said than done, things can get back on track. Sometimes a break is needed, but it should always be understood that the topic will be revisited and a resolution reached when things have cooled off. This, and every situation like it, takes practice to get the hang of.

It's at this point that some might ask, why does it have to be this hard? Shouldn't a relationship just work or not work? Well...

A relationship _not_ working is easy, Just leave it alone. Over time, unspoken assumptions and unslayed dragons will eat away at the pyramid until any minor breeze has a chance to blow it away. "Just" working is all that hard work I talked about. But just working is more than it sounds like. Just working is security. It's solidity. It's certainty. It's the kind of certainty I didn't know existed until I had it. It makes every other aspect of life better, easier, and more worth the time. 

Not everyone is cut out for this. Some are better as solo acts. But for me, and anyone else who knows in their bones they're better with a partner, the work more than pays for itself.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.
