I want to talk about domain mastery. 

Domain, in this case, means physical domain. Where you live. Your castle. Your cave. Your dwelling. Your domicile. But not just the insidey parts. Because to truly master your domain, you also need to come to grips with outer bounds of your dominion. Your personal district. Your area of rule.

- notes: "I've written about this before, but that was more to do with how increased familiarity leads to increased affinity." link to the other article
- This is more about mastery. Asserting dominance over your ft² of sovereignty.
- While eating lunch over the weekend, I gazed through the window to my back yard and the power & data lines connecting my house to the main run. _My_ lines. Ok, I pay the power company to use them and I'm technically renting them, but fuck all that, they're mine.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
