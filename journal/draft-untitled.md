The Terror of Inaction

Other people's dreams are boring. Like taxes and death, it's one of life's indisputable constants. With that out of the way, let's discuss one of mine. It's a recurring nightmare I've had for longer than I know, but it contains something novel I couldn't put my finger on until recently.

At its core, the dream consists of two parts. A setup, then an action. But here's the nightmare part: I can't ever get set up. I'm sure I've had countless versions of this dream, but the ones I remember most are sports-related. I played hockey in hich school, so those dreams involve being unable to get my skates tied properly (or forgetting some piece of equipment entirely) so I can never take the ice. In college I took up golf, so those dreams are nothing but my inability to find steady ground on the first tee so I can never swing the club. A few months ago, I logged a new entry after watching an entire weekend of NFL games: I was the kicker and couldn't find a spot to put the ball to kick off, so the game could never start. Also, there was a chain-link fence on the field for some reason, so I had to keep moving it aside.

I don't tell anyone about my dreams because, as stated earlier, fewer things are duller to the listener, so I was content to keep these to myself until my final nap in the dirt. But with the introduction of new hobby this winter, came yet another version of the dream. Its premise is simple and follows the same formula. I've got one ski on and the other ski is in the snow, awaiting the satisfying engagement of my foot into its binding. Except, like the others, I can't get my stance and the placement of the ski in enough harmony to pull the trigger and thus, be on my way.

I call these "nightmares", but they aren't scary in the traditional sense. But there _is_ something terrifying about them. These failures to launch...

<!-- Notes for next time: What do these failures to launch signify about my longstanding relationship with action/inaction?  -->


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
