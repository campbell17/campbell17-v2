Someone once paid me an innocent compliment that made me question my life and the lives of everyone else. Not counting sociopaths and narcissists, though there are plenty of them around, most people I come across are fairly self-depricating, measured, and humble. I'm also not counting kids, because they're selfish by design. 

Outline and notes for next time:

- Story teaser
- Intro to my perception of people
- Intro to my perception of me
- Surprise to hear that someone thought my life was full - this is incongruous to how I view myself (figure out me's vs. myselfs for this)
- Realization that in order to pay me such a compliment, there must be high contrast between my experiences and that of the compliment giver
- Something about how such a tiny remark has such wide and lasting impact due to it's misalignment with the image of self
- "Oh, she just doesn't realize I'm a lazy piece of shit yet. Once she got to know me, she wouldn't think my life was so full."
- But maybe I shouldn't take the experiences I've had for granted as much as I do. Not everyone is as lucky or has the freedoms and opportunities I have

Not sure where to go from here, but will think more on it
