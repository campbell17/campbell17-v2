Wins Above Replacement

You're in a booth at a restaurant. Across from you are two familiar faces. On the left, you see yourself from one year ago. On the right, you from this time next year. How different are these people?

Let's make it easier. Instead of one year, let's do five years. Five years ago, and five years from now. Who is across that table?

When we're young, every year is a tremendous jump in development. But every year we age, the value of one year as it pertains to the total percentage of our lifetime decreases. From age 87 to 88, it takes a microscope to detect any difference. But from birth to 1 year old, it's as if we're a different species. In childhood, the changes are physical, and coincide with the growth of our bodies and brains. As adults, what does growth look like?

That depends on what's important to us. That depends on the delta between what we are and what we wish we were. That depends on whether or not we're paying attention to ourselves.

For the amount of time I spend thinking about stuff like this, it strikes me as odd I don't talk about this with any friends. "If you could only pick one thing, what's something you would improve about yourself this year?" What sort of answers might we get? 

"A new job."

"Travel more."

"Spend more time with my kids."

"Exercise and eat better." Probably a ton of these.

"..."

I bet a lot of the answers would center around things people want to do, as opposed to traits they wish were different. "To be a better listener" is probably not very high on the list.

While it's possibly unhealthy to ruminate on the abundance of dead wood in our personalities in the form of bad habits, vices, grudges, and mistakes, taking a look in the attic once in a while might lead to some big leaps in quality of life. <!-- there's something here, but I'm not sure I nailed the sentiment -->

Let's make some notes:
- How do we spend our time?
- What things do we spend time on we wish we didn't?
- What would we do instead?
- Would we actually do that, or just fill that time with bullshit?
- How to prevent doing that.
- The tension between a tranquil life and that of constant self-inflicted obligation.
  - If I've done nothing but rid myself of extranneous responsibilities, how can I tell which ones will add to my WAR and which will end up becoming the things I wish I didn't spend time on?
    - Make To Know, probably. Meaning, you can't know. You have to do them all before you can tell. Damn.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
