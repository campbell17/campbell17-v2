I've been thinking a lot lately about what's next. I use the term lately loosely because I've been thinking a lot about what's next for a few years. But the exercise always leaves me unsatisfied, like a carousel ride that isn't quite long enough. I always end up back in the same place, accomplishing nothing more than a scattered series of daydreams about unfocused open-ended questions. I've read about a popular strategy in the workforce of leaving ones current job for a better one as soon as possible. The story goes, as soon as you get a new job you start looking for the next new job, each one paying better than the last so you can level up your salary 4x faster than you would waiting for annual increases at the same job. If your only goal is to make more money, I can see the logic. But what I value in my career has never been exclusive to money. What I value much more is autonomy and...what? Everyone wants autonomy. Once an acceptable financial bar is cleared, autonomy is the trait most coveted in a job. But I have autonomy. So why am I thinking about what's next? What about now is falling short of my expectations? It's how we work. On my own, I can find the energy. In a small group, let's call it one or two more people, I can find the energy. But depending on the personnel, the way we work and talk about the work is de-energizing. When done right, collaboration adds clarity and energy. When we collaborate, however, we say many words and spend many hours in meetings with no movement towards either. We have too many people not doing any things that will help anyone who pays for our software. That's my statement. We have too many people not doing any things that will help anyone who pays for our software. Where are our incentives? To capture new markets? To penetrate new industries? To find the next round of funding? I could ask these questions but since the way we talk about our work obfuscates the evidence instead of clarifying it, I'll never get an answer I could explain to someone else. An example of a clear answer is as follow: "In going after ___ market, we can look like we're a leader in that space (gross use of the word space) and new investors will be more likely to pony up for the chance to make a profit on our growth." In theory, though it doesn't align with what I think is important, I could get on board with that as a concept. At least it's honest about what we're trying to do with the business. Except, I don't really want to get on board with that. I would rather we build the best software we can, period. We're not doing that. But we SAY we're doing that. I guess that's where my wanderlust originates. 

As far as I can tell, the entire sales and marketing apparatus operates on a plane misaligned with any reality I can identify. Granted, I don't really know what goes on over there because I don't really want to know. On one hand, they're all working hard, probably much harder than me. On the other hand, I don't believe they have the customer's best interest in mind. Excuse me, did I just say salespeople aren't in it for the customers to get rich? Impossible, right? Let's start with marketing, then. 

This is a stupid screed. I have a kindergarted-level understanding of how this corporation operates, now more than ever. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
