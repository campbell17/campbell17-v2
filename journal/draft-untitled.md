- Kicking over trash cans and opening mail boxes
    - Compare to modern "wrongdoing"...it's easy to spot a trash can askew, but what if the kids are shitposting online?

When I was bike riding age, my friend and I decided it'd be fun to ride around the neighborhood kicking over people's trash cans and opening their mail boxes. A reasonable assumption for a kid in elementary school, I think...

Notes: This is a story about doing fun things that are wrong, and how the challenge of spotting these events from a parents' perspective has changed for this generation of online-only kids.


Have you ever done something fun but objectively wrong? If you're a human being, we already know the answer. The human condition encourages this. The foundation of fun is the concept of play, an activity in which only humans and (find out how many other species) participate. Play is (something fundamental to us) and those who don't do it are resigned to be not fully formed <- this is horrendous but true, fix the writing. A building block of play is risk. And it's the separation of risk and wrongdoing that determines how sustainable our brand of fun is. Skiing is risky because it's physically dangerous. But it's fun for the same reason. And the fun increases as the risk does, but only up to a point. (get back to this point somehow?) But what if every time I finished my run I raced to the bottom and sprayed the people in the lift line with the snow I kicked up? That could be fun for me, but only if the people asked me to do that. (where I'm going with this is, putting other people out can also be fun, but if it isn't their idea/they're not part of it, it's wrong.) 

Notes: After you explain this better, move on to "This one time at band camp" and tell the story about the cans and boxes. Then compare the obviousness of that being wrong with the obfuscation of the wrongness of certain social media habits? Let's see where that goes.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
