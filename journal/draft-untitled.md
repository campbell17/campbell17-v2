You should be ashamed of yourself. Seriously. You should be seriously ashamed of yourself. 

- I can see why people avoid feeling ashamed like I avoid climbing into the crawlspace in my basement. It's gross, terrible, and whenever I do it, I don't ever want to have to do it again. 
- However, there's a problem if I'm simply avoiding _feeling_ ashamed: I'm aiming at the wrong target. The feeling is one of the many gifts bestowed by human nature. It's an alarm that goes off whenever my _behavior_ is incongruous with the shoulds and should-nots of life.
- I should have sent them a card. I should have studied. I should have been on time. (blockquote?)
- I shouldn't have drank so much. I shouldn't have made fun of my classmate that time in 5th grade. I shouldn't have... (blockquote?)
- Part of the problem is I also feel shame for things I shouldn't. Knowing when the alarm is false isn't always so easy. 
- (THEREFORE) So I develop skills to tamp down the fires of shame.
- (BUT) if I'm not mindful, these can be used nefariously by the devils in my subconscious.
- Behavior is action. It's a cause. Shame is an emotion. It's an effect. 
- It's a powerful shaping tool for my future self. It's also a source of truth.
- There's a skeleton key to the padlock of shame: justification.
- For action to be justified it has to be right or reasonable. 
- Who gets to decide what's right or reasonable? That depends. My society, community, culture, era, and upbringing all have a hand in molding what I believe to be right, but there's a stronger force that guided me. My conscience. And man, does _that_ sound lame. 
- Should I throw this {handful of gravel}(think of a better example) at my friend when he's not looking? Of course not. Why? Because it's wrong. How do I know? How DO I know? If no one ever told me not to do that, how would I know it was wrong? Well...I wouldn't. I would have to do it at least once to see the result before making that distinction. And when my friend kicked my ass for throwing gravel at him, I would have my answer.
- So does that mean my conscience isn't real? Is it simply the sum of every external influence combined with the "clinical trials" I run through personal experience? (Gravel throwing was a bust, apparently. Pity.)
- Humans are feedback-dependent. 

So when I say you should be _seriously_ ashamed of yourself, I mean that literally. Take it seriously.

Notes for next time: I need to reign it in. Explore how we end up justifying wrong behavior to avoid feeling shame instead of changing the behavior itself.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
