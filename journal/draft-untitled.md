I've lived in this Locust house for three years, and I'm still learning about it. One of our showers has leaky handles. It's an old walk-in the size of a phone booth for anorexics, and has equally old handles and stems. I went through my whole life ignorant to the inner workings of old shower faucets. But that all changed when the leaking got worse. Now I know what stems are. When faced with the prospect of fixing something like this, timing plays a big part. Had we just moved in, I'd have dozens of other concerns saturating my attention and I wouldn't have the bandwidth needed to even consider fixing it myself. "Call a plumber."

But we're well established now. The major projects of high priority are behind us and the nice-to-haves are underway (but not urgent) or off in the future. These are suitable conditions to plunge into the unknown and volunteer for the inevitable pain of fumbling through fixing something we haven't the faintest clue about.

I remember the first time I mowed the lawn back in 2021. I have about an acre and a quarter, and at the time I had a push mower suitable for the only for the postage stamp lots you find in most central Florida suburbs. 

Outline: 
- Getting a feel for the bounds of the yard and the subsequent opacity that removed.
- How the circle of familiarity grows over time.
- How that circle relates to the feeling of home (the less I know about my domicile, the more it feels like someone else's. Like a hotel.)
- Lighting the basement
- Entering the crawlspace, the last frontier
- The propspect of "I don't wanna know"
- Thinking back to when we first moved and the garage was still full of stuff
- Anything relevant about the old house?

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
