Something occurred to me today. I love quite a few clowns. Not the nightmarish, something-something, more flamboyant cousin of mimes clowns. And not the irredeemable, something-something, destroy people's lives like Bernie Madoff clowns. But the well-intentioned, good-natured, otherwise fully-functioning productive citizens whose certain quirks of character illicit some of my most memorable eye rolls. God help me, I love these people.

What constitutes a lovable clown, exactly? There are only three line-in-the-sand requirements. First, you need a reasonably big personality. You can't be a clown if you're too shy to speak and consistently blend in with the floral wallpaper in the dining room. Next you need to exude positive energy. That cynical clown you know isn't a clown at all. He's just a prick. The final, and perhaps most defining trait, is the eye roll-generator. This is the tragic character flaw without which our clown would be just another outstanding person. And who needs more of them hanging around, making us all look bad?

I first discovered that I could love a clown while observing a coworker years ago. He was perennially upbeat, but like a chipper dog as opposed to an optimist. He always had the air of someone who didn't really understand what was going on, but was still happy to be there. At first I didn't know what to make of him.


Notes for next time:
When did I first discover this love? 
Why didn't I see it sooner? 
What did I do instead of loving these people before? 
Does it work retroactively? Can I think of people who I disliked before who I now love?
How has social media uncovered more lovable (and decidedly unlovable) clowns?
Who made me judge and jury?
   Was it the understanding that the world needs more of them?

The world needs more of them. (<-- Is this the ending, maybe?)




Outline/Notes (outdated)
- I love a lot of clowns. No, not clowns, but people who I consider churlish and depply flawed.
- I don't know when it happened, but the formula is something like, someone who enters the room and I roll my eyes with judgement, but I love that they're in this world and firmly believe that the world needs more of them.
- Talk about how judgemental I am, try to draw comparisons between other judgy people and people in general. 
- We're all judgy. Why? What purpose does this serve us?
- Back up the question with some theories based on research
- What do we gain by judging people right out of our lives? Is it possible to completely disagree with someone and still like them as a person? Or even love them?
- What kinds of things spark judgement in the first place? Morality. Politics. Religion. Character. Which ones are ignorable and which ones might be irreconcilable? Why?
- The role of empathy. 

What's the surprise?
Are we all clowns?
