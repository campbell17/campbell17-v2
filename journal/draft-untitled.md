<!-- Something I've been meaning to try: use headings for section transitions -->

Impermanence

Jackie O saving Grand Central

  Put quote in

Something about either trusting someone will take the reigns, or taking them yourself. Outside of those, trust in being good being good enough.




<!-- This may be irrelevant for this week's essay, leaving them here anyway: -->

Points I skipped in last essay:
- How to keep someone like that from infecting your life with their BS and taking you down with them
- I skipped an opportunity for humor in the last part - "Like I always say, 'there's something I could have done differently that may have changed the outcome' (catchy, isn't it?)"


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
