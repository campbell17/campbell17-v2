It's the kind of thing where look back and ask yourself, why the hell did I do that?

I believe some of the regrettable actions of my youth come with a cloak of inevitability. I think they were stupid, yes, but they at least contributed in some small way to shaping me. I also believe we all carry an imaginary satchel of misdeed tokens throughout our formative years, and if we don't spend them on one thing we'll eventually spend them on something else. It's our duty as curious adventurers to spend our misdeed tokens while we're still young - when the stakes are at their lowest - to avoid life-ruining disasters after we've outgrown our didn't-know-any-better armor.
- So some of my stupid actions are "glad I got that out of my system" events. I know what I did was wrong, but it was at least a passable lapse in judgement or a low-grade near miss. Had I changed my mind and saved my token that day, who knows what other possibly _more_ regrettible act I would spend it on later. Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

- But some dumb things were just dumb. Some things were just me being an ass. And the most painful things always involve someone else. Not someone else as an accomplice, but someone else as a victim of my stupidity.
- I've done all kinds of things solo that I shouldn't have, but only the most egregious get the monaker of Fully Regrettable, i.e., I would not do that again. These are acts that are not part of youthful adventurousness and thus don't relive me of any misdeed tokens. 
- But the severity level is much lower for hurting others. Rare, if ever, is the occasion where putting someone else in their place grants you fewer tokens, even for those who deserve it. 

- "What would I have done differently?" If the answer is anything other than, "Well...nothing, I guess.", you fucked up. 
- Yesterday I was helping my daughter practice parallel parking. "First, pull up next to the front car. Then cut the wheel as you back into the space..." and so on. A bit later, with her older brother in the car, I was recounting how well she did when a memory popped into my head from when I lived in the city and was extracting myself from a particularly tight parallel parking space.
- It was late at night and my girlfriend and I were leaving her apartment to drive to my parents house about 90 minutes away. I drove a somewhat battered 1995 Acura Integra. Frost white, except for the rusted spot on the dented fender I never got fixed. Manual transmission (of course), and a small car by today's standards.
- Someone had either backed in too close in front or pulled up to close behind so the space to maneuver was painfully limited. It's the amount of space that ellicits a "really??" when you come back to your car to leave. (keep going...)

- So why the hell _did_ I do that? And what _would_ I have done differently? Let's start with the latter. I would have been kinder. I would have communicated. I would get out of the car before, not after I bumped hers. I would check the gap as I calmly approached her car, shoot her a smile and start with, "Hi". I would apologize for scaring her by getting so close. I would reassure her I was doing my best not to hit her car, and ask if she or her boyfriend wouldn't mind helping spot me just to be safe. But I didn't do that. I took her trepidation and plowed ahead (or backward, in this case). And I even confirmed her fear by do the exact thing she was trying to prevent by honking. What a dick. 

But why? 

The four "I's" of the apocalypse, that's why: Impatience. Inflexibility. Immaturity. Insecurity.

In my mind, it was time to go. I had my plan and no new evidence would sway my conviction about pulling out of a space I knew I could negotiate. I hadn't grown up enough to understand that life didn't have to be a battle of wills where every other warm body is an opponent to be dominated. And I didn't have the kind of inner stability and balance necessary to quench my short fuse and put myself in someone else's shoes, even when doing so would dramatically improve the outcome.

I always try to bury these memories under the weight of any good deeds I've done, but regrets are like weeds. People say you shouldn't care what other people think about you, and to some extent I believe that. But what about the people you only meet once while being the worst version of yourself? In all this time of trying to bury this particular memory, it never occured to me to wonder if this couple ever thinks about that night as I do. "Hey honey, remember the time that asshole backed into your car on purpose?" I'm "that asshole" to someone. 

No one is perfect, but there's a difference between mistakes and malevolence. Misdeed tokens aren't spent on malevolence. So the memory of that poor couple I terrorized in the parallel parking debauch serves as a reminder to always elevate my expectations of myself to raise my "floor". The worst version of myself should never be malevolent. The worst version of myself should only even be _visible_ to those closest to me. So I put my regret to work. "Remember that time I backed into someone on purpose? Good. Make the worst version of yourself invisible to a stranger. And never be "that asshole" in anyone's memory again."

Thanks for reading.




Notes for next time: go back and finish describing the event.

Notes for next time - describe the situation further and see where it takes you. I'm not sure what the ending is yet, so maybe give that some thought before continuing the parts where you already know approximately what to write.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
