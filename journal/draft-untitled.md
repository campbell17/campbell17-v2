- Cherishing the in-betweens
    - Recognize and soak in the minutes of true freedom
        - The first 5 minutes of coming home from Lowes, pretzel in my hand, windows open
        - Sebastian Vettel doing donuts after his 4th and final world championship (use this as the intro, also check that it was his 4th and not 3rd)


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
