We don't have to write people off - we can write off their flaws instead. (translate this into a pithy adage)

- This is something about localizing our hatred to something about someone, not letting it spread to the person itself.
- I hate what certain people did to our company. When I talk to those people, however, their incompetence, negligence, and ineptitude are not primary.
- Keep in mind, there ARE some people who need writing off. But I've only consciously done it to one person. The question arises, when does writing someone off mean anything? Like last week's essay, a certain closeness is required. If I never interact with someone unredeeming, there isn't a need to write them off. I never "wrote them on" to begin with.
- Some people give off a bad vibe. But even then, I can hate their vibe without unpersoning them from my life. A decision forms in my mind on first impressions whether or not I'm going to be making myself available to this person. People who become good friends know subconsciously when they first meet each other that they're going to get along. Granted, some meaningful friendships arise out of initial bouts of adversity - one of my best friends first introduced himself by punching me in the arm for talking shit about him to the girls in our art class. Except...I never did that. Awkward. But, and this is the moment I knew he was redeemable, upon hearing the news that he got it wrong, he did the unthinkable. He apologized. We laughed about it on the spot, and the discomfort of confrontation was replaced with relief and humorous sheepishness.
- I know people who make a habit of writing whole groups of people off, proudly announcing the act on social media as if it's something universally virtuous. I'm not so sure.
- This seems lazy. I'm not sure if it's lazy, but it seems lazy. I guess I do this too, though. My group of writeoffs is, you know, criminals. Some people consider people who disagree with them criminals, so maybe that's where this behavior originates. Is this lazy of me? It's not a hard and fast rule. And it would depend on the crime. I'm digressing hard. Let's bring it back.
- My point, if one exists, is that there's energy in looking for common ground with someone who rubs me the wrong way. It's the every day version of don't hate the player hate the game. I can hate many things about a person's life choices while still avoiding allowing them to control my emotional state simply by existing. I choose who lives rent-free in my head. My friends and family. Why would I waste mental real estate on people who annoy me? The tax rate in there is astronomical.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
