On Being Biff

What would you do? Ask your handy brother-in-law? Take it to the shop or, if you like overpaying, the dealer? Not Biff.

When Biff's car wouldn't start, he fiddled and fiddled and fiddled until he cracked the secret code - the finicky, obtuse, obfuscated, and seemingly unrelated series of actions only Biff knew how to execute to reliably start his [car model here]. Now Biff doesn't even need to lock the doors.

<!-- Notes: This is about failure tolerance. How tuned into something we can get so we still learn enough to make progress after hitting a wall. [Camera story goes here - I have a older-model DSLR on a tripod I use as my webcam for Zoom calls. (write this better) The software it needs for my macbook to recognize it is fiddly. I have to do a 6 part dance sometimes to get it to turn on. Here's what that looks like. Normal people would just buy a $30 webcam on amazon, Not Biff. etc etc] 

Think of the most amazing card trick you've ever seen. Magicians are banking on our inability to fathom the time spent on a single trick. Rather, the amount of times failed before success. (And that's only half their battle - then they have to rehearse the successes often enough to become as second nature as breathing). They're the most elite failure tolerators (obviously, improve this) in the world. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
