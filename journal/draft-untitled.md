Getting into trouble...but not _too_ much trouble.

- What are the odds I ended up here instead of in juvenile detention?
- In 5th grade, I was in the middle of figuring out who I was. Then we moved.
- To avoid getting teased, or to get attention, or to try to make new friends (who the hell knows why I did these things), I perpetuated all manner of childhood "crimes".
- Some of these were inherent to my nature as a curious and mischievous boy. Others were thoughtless, bizarre, and dangerous.
- When I try to assess myself as a person, I assume I've always tried to be good, but I don't think that's accurate.
- At my 8th grade graduation, one of my classmates recited a poem describing everyone in our grade as we sat on the brink of moving to high school. "Tim is good at knowing what's right..." is how I was described in said poem. That made my parents happy, but I was slightly puzzled. Looking back, maybe I was puzzled because everyone at this school had only known me for 1.5 years up to that point.
- My behavior was so bad between 5th and 7th grade, I had to change schools. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for someone who supposedly does what's right.
- The memories I have of this time are almost all from 5th or 8th grade. Changing schools from 5th to 6th, and then again halfway through 7th, means the interim year and a half is a blur. The 7th grade switch marked a turning point and I think even I realized something had to change. I didn't want to be getting in trouble all the time, and although my streak of dishonesty (<-- gonna have to reconcile this with my decision in Berwyn to always tell the truth) continued for a while longer, I eventually came around.
- We moved again between 8th and 9th grade and I seized that opportunity (probably more unconscious maturity than explicit choice) to enjoy another clean slate. I wanted (most of) my choices to have defensible outcomes.
- Somehow I still did dumbass shit like driving my friend home (at a snail's pace) without my license, but other times I stood my ground, though collected some guilt by association (zima). 
- The part that interests me now that the insanity is behind me is the sheer luck of getting to the other side relatively unscathed. How much of this was always going to happen, i.e., if I _did_ end up in juvvy, would I still have turned over a new leaf when given the opportunity?
- Something else to consider - my parents hand in taking the necessary actions to turn the ship around. I changed schools almost as much as a military kid, in K, 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 8th grade. Two of those were relocation-induced, but one of those relocations was a direct result of the dissatisfaction my parents had with how things were going, not just for me.
- When I consider where I am and compare it to where I could have ended up, it seems nothing short of miraculous. 

Notes for next time: Will this work while violating the "one moment" Global note? Give that a think. Also, maybe think a little about whether or not near-misses lead to a reformation or a let-it-ride attitude. Do I want to compare my kids' lives lack of trouble with mine and those of my gen? Is this a commentary on the types of trouble kids got into then vs. now? Do I even know enough about now to compare? 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
