_Now on to this week's essay._

I punched my friend Max in the face as hard as I could. In the nose, to be exact. He let out an ungodly yelp and rushed to the bathroom so he didn't get blood all over his bedroom. This was a highly unfortunate turn of events when you consider I was actually aiming for his older brother's ribcage.

For me, there's a moment during childhood roughhousing when it goes from innocent fun to over the line, and the gradient between those states is nil. It's like when you pet a dog a bit too hard for a bit too long and he snaps like a venus fly trap, though at least with the dog you might get a growl of warning. However, this haymaker, and my subsequent premature departure from a highly anticipated sleepover, represents the worst case of instant rage I ever experienced. I was 9 or 10, and nothing has come close since.

I arrive at Max's house just after lunch on a Saturday. Our big plans for the day include some emergent combination of video games, nerf battles, hacky sack, Mouse Trap™, and trying to hit each other in the face with balled-up socks from the other end of the hallway. The primary objective of every activity is to become unable to continue due to incapacitation-by-laughter. Mix in some time running around outside, a snack-raid (my friends _always_ had better snacks), and staying up too late, and we'd have one flawlessly executed sleepover.

We're about an hour into playing Sega in Max's room when his brother Christian pops his head in. Siblings are a wildcard. They can either add to the fun by joining in or throw a blanket over it by constantly antagonizing us. Max has two. His sister is two years older and keeps to herself. In fact, if she didn't occasionally wander out of her bedroom to do...whatever is is girls do, I wouldn't even know he had a sister. His brother is much older. Seven years, so he's well into his teens. To me, a 9 year-old pipsqueak, he may as well have a full beard and be walking around with a briefcase and newspaper smoking a pipe. 

Notes for next time:
- They get along well enough, but his brother is an enigma. I don't know what makes a teenager tick, so in my mind he's either an overachiever on his way to becoming a chemist or a drifter who's into hard drugs.
- Anyway on this particular occasion, Christian is bored and decides to remedy this by instigating a little wrestle with Max and I. We audible away from Sega and join in immediately.
- Obviously when it comes to physicality, Christian holds all the cards. 
- Describe the nature of the wrestling
- Describe "then it took a turn..."
- Describe the flip being both physical and mental
- Describe the sudden rage and instant reaction
- Describe not realizing Max's face was on the opposite side of Christian's torso
- Describe the mistake of closing my eyes while swinging for the fences
- Describe the chaos of the aftermath, his mom coming in, my mom getting the call, and the sleepover ending early.
- Describe the next time I saw him at the baseball game on the opposite team.
- Describe shaking his had at the end and still feeling so bad.
- It ends around here, but not sure what the ending is. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
