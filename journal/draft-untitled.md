I don't know what compelled us to do it. Maybe we wanted to pretend to be older. Or maybe curiosity got the better of us and we just wanted to see what would happen. Either way, we thought it would be hilarious. At 13 years old, nearly everything was hilarious. We look at each other and nod. Then, as naturally as we can, we approach the convenience store cashier, reach over the glass, and place our two bottles of beer on the counter.

We were certain a teacher would see us sneaking away from the building before school started and yell at us to come back. But they didn't. So we kept walking up the hill toward the Cash & Carry convenience store, which sounds more like a euphemism for armed robbery than a place to buy donuts and fill up with gas. Once we decided to buy non-alcoholic beer instead of Mountain Dew to wash down our PB&J lunches, we were certain the checkout clerk would yell at us for being idiots and make us put it back. But he didn't. So we pay for our faux beer - one O'Doul's and one Miller Sharp's to be exact - and we make the short walk back to the school, stashing the bounty in our backpacks along the way. But do we actually have the guts to crack a beer during lunch?

The tricky part, so we thought, was acquiring the beverages. But even _making it_ to lunch is under serious threat. Concentrating during our morning classes is out of the question. All I keep doing is picturing the looks on my classmates' faces when I simulate Miller time over a peanut butter & jelly with the crusts cut off. 

Notes for next time: Continue the but/therefore train. Examine the risk/reward for a joke. That last line is pretty good. See if we can keep up that vibe.


- Sneaking away from the school premises in the first place
- Back then, students weren't hawked like they are now
- Oh btw, they sold it to us
- stashing it in our bags
- the big reveal
- our larger-than-life, yet friendly lunch aide simply confiscated them with an amused look - not chastising in any way
- oh btw, we didn't get in trouble
- I still had one in my backpack and drank some on the bus on the way home. 
- oh btw, it was gross
- There's something about the practice of acting older than your age. Try to describe that something.

Where's the conflict? Do I just fill the whole thing with butTherefores:

We were certain someone would see us and stop us sneaking away from the building before school started. But they didn't. So we kept walking up the hill toward the Cash & Carry convenience store, which sounds more like a euphemism for armed robbery than a place to buy donuts and fill up with gas. 

Notes for next time: Would be good in a story form, similar to the rock throwing essay?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
