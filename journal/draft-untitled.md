- Kicking over trash cans and opening mail boxes
    - Compare to modern "wrongdoing"...it's easy to spot a trash can askew, but what if the kids are shitposting online?

When I was bike riding age, my friend and I decided it'd be fun to ride around the neighborhood kicking over people's trash cans and opening their mail boxes. A reasonable assumption for a kid in elementary school, I think...

Notes: This is a story about doing fun things that are wrong, and how the challenge of spotting these events from a parents' perspective has changed for this generation of online-only kids.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
