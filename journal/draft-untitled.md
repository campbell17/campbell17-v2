You don't have to do everything.

- It was back-to-school night for my 7th grader. We did not go. I think we're supposed to meet the teachers and get a sense of the lesson plan, but that sounds a lot like something I don't want to do. We moved to this area because of the quality of the schools. We trusted them enough to establish new roots - what am I going to do, nitpick the way they teach my kids?

- There's a duality to the squeaky wheel getting the grease. It's clearly selfish of us to not want to spend out time meeting the teachers. Allowing them to put faces to our names adds squeak to any wheel that may get stuck during the school year vis a vis our child. "Pfff, they didn't even come to BTS night, why would I break my neck for their kid??" and so on.

But...

We're grown-ass people. And back to school night is optional. Even if they say it's mandatory, it isn't. 

This sounds a lot like cope. Like I'm justifying not playing along by saying I don't actually have to play along. But I think about all the things people do 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
