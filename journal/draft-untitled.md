It's the kind of thing you look back on and ask yourself, why the hell did I do that?

I believe some of the regrettable actions of my youth come with a cloak of inevitability. I think they were stupid, yes, but they at least contributed in some small way to shaping me. I also believe we all carry an imaginary satchel of misdeed tokens throughout our formative years, and if we don't spend them on one thing we'll eventually spend them on something else. It's our duty as curious adventurers to spend our misdeed tokens while we're still young - when the stakes are at their lowest - to avoid life-ruining disasters after we've outgrown our didn't-know-any-better armor.
- So some of my stupid actions are "glad I got that out of my system" events, which play the part of the Devil I know. Had I come to my senses and saved my token that day, who knows what other possibly _more_ regrettible act I would choose to spend it on later.

- But some dumb things were just dumb. Some things were just me being an ass. And the most painful things always involve someone else. And not someone else as an accomplice. Someone else as a victim of my stupidity.
- I've done all kinds of things solo that I shouldn't have, but only the most egregious get the monaker of Fully Regrettable, i.e., I would not do that again. These are acts that are not part of youthful adventurousness and thus don't relive me of any misdeed tokens. 
- But the severity level is much lower for hurting others. Rare, if ever, is the occasion where putting someone else in their place grants you fewer tokens, even for those who deserve it. 

- "What would I have done differently?" If the answer is anything other than, "Well...nothing, I guess.", you fucked up. 
- Yesterday I was helping my daughter practice parallel parking. "First, pull up next to the front car. Then cut the wheel as you back into the space..." and so on. A bit later, with her older brother in the car, I was recounting how well she did when a memory popped into my head from when I lived in the city and was extracting myself from a particularly tight parallel parking space.
- It was late at night and my girlfriend and I were leaving her apartment to drive to my parents house about 90 minutes away. I drove a somewhat battered 1995 Acura Integra. Frost white, except for the rusted spot on the dented fender I never got fixed. Manual transmission (of course), and a small car by today's standards.
- Someone had either backed in too close in front or pulled up to close behind so the space to maneuver was painfully limited. It's the amount of space that ellicits a "really??" when you come back to your car to leave.


Notes for next time - describe the situation further and see where it takes you. I'm not sure what the ending is yet, so maybe give that some thought before continuing the parts where you already know approximately what to write.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
