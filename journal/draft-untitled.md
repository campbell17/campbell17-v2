Being useful for its own sake.

- What happened to us? Have we become so self absorbed we unilaterally decided not to lift a finger without compensation? I recently rewatched two of Studio Ghibli's most well-known features, My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. Amidst all the breathtaking art and magical storytelling one comes to expect from director Hayao Miyazaki, I was struck by one thing: how useful the main characters are. 

- Describe what they did to make themselves seem useful. This isn't a film review, so keep it general.
- Talk about how I felt when I was a kid, how my kids feel every time I ask them to do something.
- Is this cultural?
- What could be done differently?
- I remember I saw a clip of a Japanese show where a father was asking his 3 or 4 year old to do a trick on a jungle gym bar. The boy couldn't do it, but instead of saying ok and letting him give up, the father sat back and encouraged him to keep trying until he achieved it. The boy cried and kept trying to stop, but the father insisted. At the time, I thought this was cruel. He was so young, I thought, and I didn't understand why a parent would be so harsh. But looking back, it's obvious the father was acting as a coach, pushing the child beyond his self-imposed limit, to teach him that his opinion of a tasks difficulty is just an opinion he can disprove with enough persistence. 
- When I used to ask my youngest child to help bring in the groceries, he acted like he'd been selected for institutional torture. 
- It's not fair to my kids to protect them from work. It's allowing them to live under the false pretense that it doesn't exist. The first time my youngest had to empty the dishwasher he almost hyperventilated. My weaknessess tried to convince me he was too young and it would rob him of his childhood to make him do chores. I'd be robbing him of something, for sure, but not his childhood. His usefulness. And being useful is a cornerstone of self-worth. 
- I wish I'd been more generous with these lessons. In essense, I'm passing on uselessness disguised as an unwillingness to deal with the discomfort of my children's protests. That Japanese father in the playground wasn't cruel, he was giving. He was giving his son the gift of work ethic, a pattern the 4 year old would follow the rest of his life.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
