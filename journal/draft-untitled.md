I want to talk about domain mastery. 

Domain, in this case, means physical domain. Where you live. Your castle. Your cave. Your dwelling. Your domicile. But not just the insidey parts. Because to truly master your domain, you also need to come to grips with outer bounds of your dominion. Your personal district. Your area of rule.

- notes: "I've written about this before, but that was more to do with how increased familiarity leads to increased affinity." link to the other article
- This is more about mastery. Asserting dominance over your ft² of sovereignty.
- While eating lunch over the weekend, I gazed through the window to my back yard and the power & data lines connecting my house to the main run. _My_ lines. Ok, I pay the power company to use them and I'm technically renting them, but nerts to that, they're mine. Everything is mine. You know why? Because when something is mine, it becomes my responsibility to fix what's wrong with it.
- I do this not because I'm in love with being on the hook for every tiny thing that needs maintenance, though that's part of it (it's nice to feel needed). I do this because it cuts out huge amounts of pain in the ass telephone game with whoever does end up fixing it. And by the way, who should I call? That question in itself is often a boondoggle and I can usually fix most problems in the time it takes just to get that squared away. I'll give you an example.
- The other night my nightly routine of throwing my life away watching sports was interrupted by a loud crunching sound from outside. I live amongst the trees and their indifference comes down in the form of branches pelting my house and yard. Based on the origin of the sound, I deduced that a branch fell on part of the roof just behind where I was sitting. I put on some shoes and stepped outside to corroborate my hypothesis. The sound, as it turned out, came from the mast that holds the run of power and data lines from the main pole behind my back yard. But the branch was not on the roof, nor was it on the ground near the roof. It was laying over the power lines halfway between my house and the pole. The lines are low, so they have mounting brackets attached to a tree about 15 feet up from where the branch came down. There's no way to know, but I think the sound came from the impact of the branch breaking the lines off their mounting brackets and the subsequent whiplash crashing into the mast on the house. Either way I was floored the lights didn't flicker since mine is the kind of power that quivers when someone sneezes too hard.
- To complicate matters, I have a quadrangle of string lights above the fire pit in that same area. By coincidence, the day prior, one of those strings came down on its own so it was already on the ground and not subjected to the force of the branch. Two of the four strings remained alight so I could at least see what I was doing while I brought the mini chainsaw to bear on the ends of the branches caught up in the power line.
- First, I had to test if the line was live with the brilliant strategy of slapping the edge of the main branch like Joe Pesci testing the hot doorknob in Home Alone. I didn't die, so it seemed ok to proceed. Safety Third™.
- What followed was a series of semi-strategic cuts to simultaneously free the line from the branch ends while not giving myself a concussion in the process. The saving grace of this entire situation was the fact that the majority of the weight of the branch was already on the ground and leaning against its mother, the tremendous oak tree holding up one corner of the lights. Based on my forensic analysis of the impact area and the lights still being on, I inferred the branch fell straight down, pierced the ground at the base of the oak, and then laid itself over the power lines as it came to rest. Had the branch hit the lines directly, the generator would still be running.
- In a matter of minutes, I had the branch dismembered and piled up next to the fire pit in a display of foreshadowing of her ultimate fate. Phase one of the recovery was complete.
- The next day, 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
