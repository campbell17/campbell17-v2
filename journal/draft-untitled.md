You're a boat. 

You're in open water. You have control of your heading and your speed. You have some navigational equipment and a view of what's ahead. 

There are storms out there.

Most boats avoid the storms. But sometimes the storms look interesting. There's excitement in thunder. So sometimes you head towards a storm to see what there is to see. 

You take on some damage. The storm punches a few holes in your hull.

Most boats repair the holes. But to make repairs they have to stop. You think stopping takes too long. So you maintain your speed and continue looking for storms.

But there are blue skies somewhere out there, too. The sailing is smoother if you can find them.

Most boats use their navigation equipment. But to do that requires reading the manual. You think reading the manual is boring. So you assume you don't need it.

Sometimes people ask you to help them catch fish.

Most boats let people install a trawl. But doing that is tough work and takes time away from playing in storms. You think that's beneath you. So you hold out for something better.

The marina has free upgrades available.

Most boats spend time making improvements. But upgrades require an honest evaluation of what needs fixing. You assume you're already doing your best. So you don't bother evaluating.

There's an island across the sea with other boats and a welcoming dock where you can settle down.

Most boats set their navigation for that island. But to do that means leaving the storms behind for good. You think you can't live without the storms. So you never even look in that direction.

You're a boat. 

You have water in your hull from playing in storms. 

You're sinking because you wouldn't stop to repair. 

You're lost because you never learned to navigate. 

You're useless because you never helped people fish. 

You're falling apart inside because you never bothered to upgrade. 

And you're alone because you never considered the island to be something worth finding.

The other boats are not responsible for this. Every choice you've ever made directed you precisely to this moment. You're time playing in storms has come to an end.

Make repairs. 

Bail the water.

Read the manual.

Install the net.

Evaluate the upgrades.

And go find your island.





When you've had your fill of excitement, and if you're fortunate enough to only get a few small holes, you leave the storm so you can take some time to evaluate the damage and make repairs.

But after a few storms you realize it gets a little harder to recognize the damage each time. So you spend less time looking for storms and practice finding excitement in blue skies.

But sometimes to find clear weather, you have to use your equipment. And if you neglect it while you're chasing storms, you forget how it works.

You've got some holes. These holes are small and hard to find, and while they don't let much water in right away, a steady trickle begins to flow.

"But it's not _too much_", you think. "I can probably last a long time without repairs. Besides, repairing myself is hard. I have to stop moving and look deep inside my hull where it's dark."


Most boats look for an island. There's a fancy marina there. You can 

<!-- storms = bad choices -->
<!-- holes = health -->
<!-- instruction manual = education -->
<!-- fishing net = employment -->
<!-- upgrades = self improvement -->
<!-- Island = family -->



Most boats look for ____. You don't need ____. ____ is for squares.



You wish some other boats would help you. But the other boats have some holes, too. They have their own repairs to make.

So you use your vision to look for a blue sky. 

At some point, you find the instructions to your navigational equipment. But if it's been too long since you looked at them, you forget how to read.

Now you're in open water without your navigational equipment. You've got some holes. These holes are small and hard to find, and while they don't let much water in right away, a steady trickle begins to flow. 

"But it's not _too much_", you think. "I can probably last a long time without repairs. Besides, repairing myself is hard. I have to stop moving and look deep inside my hull where it's dark."





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
