Why Action Always Wins
And the duality of importance.

"When in doubt, bias toward action."

This is the principle that allows us to hold the following two beliefs at the same time: 

1. Everything is important. Work the details, because it matters. You're investing in your future self by doing so. Cut corners at your peril.

2. Nothing is important. Just get it done, because it doesn't matter. No one will remember anyway. It'll all come out in the wash.

Notice neither scenario involves _not doing_ something. "It doesn't matter", in this case, is a misnomer. Because _it_ is defined as the care and attention put toward an action, as opposed to the action itself. The action always matters.

In the absence of action, all games play out in theory but none get played in reality. Reality is the punch in, "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face." But making a habit of inaction breeds an even deeper problem. It incentivizes our brain to stop creating the ideas that lead to taking action in the first place.

And growth is a practical measurement, not a theoretical one. I can't _think_ my way to personal growth even though that's how the process begins. I have to try something out to see how my mind and body react to what it's like in the physical world, a.k.a. reality[1]. I heard of a class of 11 year-olds undertaking a school assignment to go home and do something they've never done before. One wise parent handed their child some cash, a list of ingredients needed to cook a meal, and sent them to the grocery store. At one point, the student couldn't find one of the items and was so terrified to ask an employee for help, they fled the store. Once outside, realizing they still had to get it done, they took a deep breath, turned around, and went back in to face the music. That, my friends, is growth. And the way to achieve that brand of growth is through exposure to the real McCoy.

Action is the only way to discover the undiscovered. Our fleeing student couldn't conceive of failing to find one of the items until it actually happened. It's the same reason I can't learn to knit or ice skate or chop wood by reading about it on the internet. There are 157 subtle, unexpected details that emerge in the first 5 minutes of doing anything. These nuances immediately liquidate most of the broad-stroked instruction I got from searching "how to do a hockey stop" on YouTube.


<!-- These are two different essays...Above is one, and below is two. Write both.
Notes for above: Talk more about how much things suck at first, but that's part of what it means to do _anything_. Sebastian getting discouraged because rollerblading is hard. Complaining about the sticks on the driveway, and how hard it is to use the brake. But at first, everything is mode 2. Just get it done. Don't even use the brake yet. The low fidelity of this stage is necessary to keep it palatable while you're getting your feet wet.

Notes for below: He's never done something like this before. He doesn't play with tools. He doesn't build or fix things. He hasn't yet developed those curiosities about the physical world. But if he keeps doing nothing but gaming, in 10 years he will be miserable and he won't know how to operate in society. <-- this is the short version, make it less harsh and explain the upward nature of doing compared to the static nature of not doing.

Right now we're creeping our way toward the end of summer. In the futile hope of counteracting some of the gratuitous amounts of video games I've let my youngest son play, I assigned him a little project this week.

## The Mission

Let's talk about toilets. Specifically, the lid/seat arrangement of toilets. With the seat and lid fully down, the toilet is closed for business. You can sit on it to hide from that lecherous party guest, but that's about it. With the seat and lid fully up, the toilet is a standing room only venue. In between, however - lid up, but seat down, things can get challenging. When in standby mode, our lids are always fully closed. Somehow as a family we all agreed on that, which is a feat in itself. This means every time the boys step up to bat, part of our routine is reaching down to lift the lid and seat up.

I promise this is going somewhere.

One of our toilets, however, has a lid that overhangs the seat by just enough to take conscious effort to wedge your fingers under the seat to get them both skyward. 

<!-- This should be longer. 
Tell the story about the toilet seat but that's not the end. It's one piece. 
Expand on the differences between doing something right away and talking forever. -->

<!-- NOTES: Go with the project idea, or push it down and start a new thread after "hockey stop". -->

[1] The analog for this in building and maintaining relataionships (as opposed to learning an objective skill) is open, honest communication. Communication is the action, and our realities work with each other to bolster the strong ideas and burn off the weak ones.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
