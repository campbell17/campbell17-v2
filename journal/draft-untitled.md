I hate this goddamn part so much.

Let me explain.

There's a phenomenon I experience when I attain an acceptable level of competence with something after steady practice. I get worse.

When I begin learning something new, it takes a lot of focus and energy to improve. If I don't concentrate enough, I risk developing bad habits that will stunt the growth of my skill, possibly even lowering the potential ceiling I can reach.

But after I get my feet under me, the gap between my potential and my current skill begins to shrink. I start getting good. When I get good, things that took concerted effort before are instead internalized as muscle memory, freeing up my mind and energy to focus on finer details. But I like to daydream.

And when I'm daydreaming, I'm not growing my skills to internalize those finer details. I'm running on autopilot.

I ran into this concept whenever I took long breaks from playing ice hockey. Toward the end of a season, I felt stuck, slow, and useless on the ice. When the season ended, I'd get caught up in other things and miss the next season or two. When I came back, though I was in worse shape, I performed at a much higher level in the first few games because I was back in learning mode, trying my best to knock the rust off. But like clockwork, as the season wore on, things would peter out again. 

It's possible this is all in my head. That I only _felt_ like I was better at the start of a new season, and any increased point production was a mere coincidence. Moreover, after noticing this phenomenon once, now I'd be looking for it, which introduces confirmation bias into the mix. So even when the sport changes - say, from hockey to golf - I'll always see the pattern emerge.

But I don't think it's in my head. Because I don't think I'm alone. This is math as much as it is behavioral.

Here's a common representation of the learning curve. There's a floor, where no skill exists, and a ceiling, where our highest possible version of a skill exists. The x axis represents time. I've heard the bottom third of the curve described as "the suck zone", because all we're doing is fumbling around in the dark trying not to hurt ourselves. But then the tide changes, and we hit the base of the ramp with some momentum despite all our clumsy bumbling. Now we're making significant gains in a short time. We've found something to grab onto. Some amount of "correctness". And finding this correctness amidst all the uselessness of the suck zone slaps our brains with a jolt of energy and focus in an effort to capture and build on it so we avoid losing our place and having to start over.

We ride this part for as long as possible.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
