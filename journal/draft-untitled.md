I thought I could wait her out. 

It was late. I was tired. I had 100 arithmetic problems staring up at me from their crisp off-white ditto paper. An hour ago I could have completed a few. Forty-five minutes ago I could have completed a few more. Thirty minutes ago I could have been done. But no. I decided I wasn't going to do this assignment. I was seated in the kitchen at the table in the center of the room. The light overlooking the table faded into darkness as if falling from a cliff. I was left alone for this task. I didn't know how much time had passed, but I had no intention of tending to these math problems. I thought I could wait her out.

I sloutched in the chair. The smooth pleather seat let me slip down until my butt hung completely off the edge, burying my chin in my chest as the backrest pressed against my skull. I repeated this many times.

It's odd. Though I knew I had no intention of doing this math homework, I also had no intention of clueing my mother in. My plan was simple. Do nothing. The point of doing nothing was to defer these problems to not-now. Maybe tomorrow, I wasn't sure, but I was sure not-now was preferable. When you're naive, you cling to a hope that "maybe tomorrow" could become "maybe never". Maybe this was my way of taking a stand. 100 math problems on one sheet of paper? And when I complete these, what then? WHERE DOES IT END?? So I decided to end it there. I decided I wasn't going to do any of these 100 math problems. I decided to wait her out.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
