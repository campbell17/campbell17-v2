Something occurred to me today. I love quite a few clowns. Not the nightmarish, something-something, more flamboyant cousin of mimes clowns. And not the irredeemable, something-something, destroy people's lives like Bernie Madoff clowns. But the well-intentioned, good-natured, otherwise fully-functioning productive citizens whose certain quirks of character illicit some of my most memorable eye rolls. God help me, I love these people.

What constitutes a lovable clown, exactly? There are only three line-in-the-sand requirements. First, you need a reasonably big personality. You can't be a clown if you're too shy to speak and consistently blend in with the floral wallpaper in the dining room. Next you need to exude positive energy. That cynical clown you know isn't a clown at all. He's just a prick. The final, and perhaps most defining trait, is the eye roll-generator. This is the tragic character flaw without which our clown would be just another outstanding person. And who needs more of them hanging around, making us all look bad?

I first discovered that I could love a clown while observing a coworker years ago. He was perennially upbeat, but like a chipper dog as opposed to an optimist. He always had the air of someone who didn't really understand what was going on, but was still happy to be there. At first I didn't know what to make of him, but eventually he became a part of the scenery. Note: I don't know where to go with this so I'm moving on.

Note: maybe scrap the above paragraph and begin the next with something like "It wasn't always this way. I used to be super judgy. Before I learned to love I felt disdain. I was closed-minded. I wrote people off."

What came before love? Close-mindedness. Disdain. Writing people off. "This person acts in a way I don't approve, so I must disassociate myself from them now and forever." This is the wrong way to be. I recently stumbled across a journal entry while I was looking through an old sketchbook. That in itself is bizarre because I never kept a journal, but for some reason I decided after a particularly bad day to write down my thoughts for, I dunno, posterity? Anyway, what I read was shocking. I thought I remembered the contents of that writing, but I clearly blocked some stuff out. I was ranting about one of my roommates getting drunk, how I hated people who drank, and _all this shit I had no idea I had a problem with back then_! I've talked about how frail our memory is before, but jesus. (Note: pull it out and get into some more details if relevant.) And I didn't just memory-hole a tiny aside in an otherwise coherent diary; this anti-underage drinking screed accounted for half the content. I've tried a few times to trace time forward from that moment to figure out when I softened my stance, but it's tough sledding trying to pick through that rubble. If I had to wager a guess, I probably changed my tune when I reached legal drinking age. Maybe all that animosity bubbled out of my being the consummate timid rule follower, and seeing people enjoy themselves without "permission" rubbed me the wrong way. Regardless of when it actually happened, I eventually grew out of that mode of thinking by meeting enough people who had the opposite outlook to realize _I_ was the outlier, not they.

Though I consider this progress, at this point I'd only learned to soften my judgement of people's recreational activities. I didn't make any progress toward the differences in personalities, philosophies, beliefs, and so on. It's hard wired into us (citation needed - google, or look at Sapiens, the idea of tribalism or judging ourselves by our differences for survival/evolutionary purposes) to judge each other by our differences, and I'm not suggesting everyone gets a passing grade. But I do want to scrutinize how easy it is to judge otherwise _good_ people right out of our lives for not thinking like us.

Before social media got out of hand, it wasn't as easy to know everyone's inner-most thoughts. It might take 7 Chipotle salad bowls for me to learn that Gustavo from finance believes the earth is flat, or 13 breakroom chats with Vanessa to learn she doesn't think women should vote. Gustavo's a great guy and his flat-earth theories are harmless, so as long as he's not ardently trying to convert me, we can still hang out. But what about Vanessa? Sure, we avoid eye contact now, but she was downright saintly before we caught wind of that little secret. How extreme does someone's opinion have to be to disqualify them from 


Notes for later: Continue the thought - what's the threshold for disavowing people?


Push more on the change between closed and open-mindedness, talk about how I'm lucky I made some of those mental changes before the internet age, I dunno...



When did I first discover this love? 
Why didn't I see it sooner? 
What did I do instead of loving these people before? 
Does it work retroactively? Can I think of people who I disliked before who I now love?
How has social media uncovered more lovable (and decidedly unlovable) clowns?
Who made me judge and jury?
   Was it the understanding that the world needs more of them?

The world needs more of them. (<-- Is this the ending, maybe?)




Outline/Notes (outdated)
- I love a lot of clowns. No, not clowns, but people who I consider churlish and depply flawed.
- I don't know when it happened, but the formula is something like, someone who enters the room and I roll my eyes with judgement, but I love that they're in this world and firmly believe that the world needs more of them.
- Talk about how judgemental I am, try to draw comparisons between other judgy people and people in general. 
- We're all judgy. Why? What purpose does this serve us?
- Back up the question with some theories based on research
- What do we gain by judging people right out of our lives? Is it possible to completely disagree with someone and still like them as a person? Or even love them?
- What kinds of things spark judgement in the first place? Morality. Politics. Religion. Character. Which ones are ignorable and which ones might be irreconcilable? Why?
- The role of empathy. 

What's the surprise?
Are we all clowns?
