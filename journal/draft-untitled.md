I saw a kid on a quad. We were driving back from the car dealership where I'd just plunked down the modicum of thousands we saved up to buy my newly-licensed daughter a car. But that milestone was immediately overshadowed the moment I saw this kid. No helmet. Going full chat on a dirty grass trail about 40 yards from the edge of the road. That's the most freedom I've ever witnessed first-hand. Just a kid on a quad. 

It reminds me of one summer when I visited a friend from out of town. I don't remember whose house it was, but they were having a party and the place was full. Their yard sloped downhill from the sides, down to a flat area with a beach volleyball court for some reason. This was rural Pennsylvania...or maybe it was West Virginia. The circumstances of how we got there are lost, making the day we spent there seem even more dreamlike. They had a quad. And they let us ride it. 

For what seemed like hours we did counter-clockwise laps, up the hill, across the front yard, down the other side, and across the court, ducking under the net as we raced through. This was my first time riding an ATV, so our first time around we rode tandem. I was in the back and my friend drove. It was a small quad, so there wasn't much room. I didn't know what to do when I sat down, so I just kinda sat there until my friend tore ass across the beach leaving me suspended in mid air behind him like Wile E. Coyote. He immediately stopped. Not because he was concerned, but because he couldn't see in front of him through the tears of laughter.

Notes? Who knows man. Keep going. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
