Root Beer Injustice

- I don't know how it is for everyone else, but I must have won the memory lottery.
- When I look back on certain times in my life - say, my pre-teen years, and I really try to _feel_ the feelings I experienced, I get intense nostalgia about even the things that went wrong.
- Maybe this is how nostalgia plays out for everyone. But even the acutely painful and embarrassing turds are polished to a mirror sheen and placed on a little stand in a climate-controlled acrylic case to join the other exhibits in my personal history museum.
- Case in point, when I was 12, I was hanging out with a friend. We rode our bikes to a convenience store. He bought a drink, and I bought one, too. Mine was a delicious root beer in a glass bottle. I didn't have that much money, but I had enough for this at least. When we left the store and got back on our bikes, I held my root beer against the handle bar so I could negotiate the hop off the sidewalk curb back onto the street. (OMG this is boring, obvs fix it). The impact of the bunny hop dislodged my precious root beer, causing the bottle to smash on the pavement and robbing me of my only joy in the world.
- I went back inside and grabbed another one, telling the clerk of my misfortune, half-hoping he would comp me the next one as a tough-luck-kid consolation prize. He did not.
- So I bought a second root beer.
- Now, one would think that an abundance of caution would be on the table for my next attempt at the convenience store egress. One would think that.
- But I held the bottle against the handlebar in a frighteningly similar fashion. However, THIS time I'll _walk_ the bike off the edge of the curb. I ain't nobody's fool. I proceed to gently (for a 12 year old) lower the front of the bike down from the sidewalk, and summarily drop the second bottle within an inch of the first bottle's wreckage. So close, in fact, that one would be forgiven for thinking only a single bottle was sacrificed to the convenience store parking lot gods that day.
- This...was not fair. When you're a kid you often feel like life isn't fair, but until this point I hadn't yet dunked on myself so hard that I shattered the glass. And in this case, I shattered the backboard AND my tasty refreshments.
- My recollection of what came next is an irrecoverable memory. Either I went back in for a third drink and subsequently chose to hitchhike home in a suspicious-looking white van rather than risk compromising my last shot at soft-drink satisfaction, or I had no more money and thus performed the rite of seppuku in the shade of the cherry blossoms for bringing such shame upon my household. Regardless, the epilogue of the great root beer bottle caper isn't the chapter in question. Because despite all the raw and heartbroken feelings I experienced in those moments, when I withdraw that event from my memory bank, it essentially registers as, "Man, how awesome was it riding bikes to the convenience store with my friends back then?" 
- This is clearly the perspective of an insane person.
- So what's actually going on here? Am I just lucky? Why do I recall anything about that event if I'm just going to whitewash my memory of the uncomfortable parts? I don't even remember what friend I was hanging out with that day, but apparently _that_ trip to the convenience store is a seminal event in my adolescence?

It's as if there are two phases to any given memory. Phase one takes place in its aftermath, in the immediate years following the event. This phase outputs an accurate depiction of the visceral feelings experienced at the time of the event. Phase two only kicks in after enough time has passed to sand down the raw edges of those visceral feelings, leaving behind a more abstract perspective. The pace of the change in phase likely depends on the level of anguish experienced at the time, with more time needed for the notable humiliations.

Keep in perspective, however, this concept only holds water when the event is sub-catastrophic. It's fun to explore the unreliability of an awkward memory turned fond, but some memories can't (and shouldn't) enter phase two.

Notes 2: Maybe kill the buzzkill part above? I need an ending, so maybe focus on the progress we're afforded by sweeping the sad stuff under the rug and keeping the wider perspective. Is this just a product of an optimist? Maybe a pessimist would never consider that there was a sense of freedom in riding bikes around and that even having the opportunity to buy a drink at the store with a friend was a gift?

Notes 1: Am I just lucky? Why remember anything about it at all if I'm just going to twist the reality? Is this a simple case of the effect of time smoothing the rough edges so we can continue to make progress instead of paralyzing ourselves with deep regret over past humiliations? I don't even remember what friend I was hanging out with that day. 

Possible ending: But what did I learn? If you step in a bear trap, maybe don't step in the same bear trap 5 minutes later? I guess that's a pretty useful lesson to learn. It's a shame it cost me two root beers. I bet those would have been tasty.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
