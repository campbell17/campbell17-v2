- This happened this morning. 
- I don't know who to thank, but I felt nothing. I unplugged the optical cable, the AC plug, and the only HDMI cable that wasn't ripped out by the fall.
- I slid the TV to the side and rested it gently against the couch. Damage unknown. But the fix is already happening in my mind.
- Maybe I felt nothing because I expected this was a possibility when I took a shortcut installing the mount.
- Funny thing about taking shortcuts, there's always time to do it right the second time.
- So I got to fixing it.
- BUT, I can't. Yet. Why wasn't this done correctly in the first place? I'm blocked by a plywood upright.
- A few months back, I took a weekend to visit my parents and build a spice rack with my dad. 
- We're close, and we're creative, but amazingly, we'd never done a project like this.
- My dad, generous as always, gave me an unused utility saw. He bought it and never used it and figured I'd be more likely to give it a hot supper.
- Now, as I stare at the empty expanse where my TV used to be, I know what stopped me from doing it right the first time. No utility saw.
- Find the studs. Done. Cut the hole. Done. Replace the mount properly. Well...
- Pre drilling needed. 2 benefits: 1, give the lag bolts a path into the stud so they don't wander. 2, test the "stud" to make sure it's really a stud. 
- 1st bolt doesn't go all the way in. Something harder than wood is preventing it from going all the way in, but it does go in about 2 inches out of the 4.
- Gotta go to Ace. Need 6 bolts.

I’ve spent 1000s of hours studying the top storytellers in the world.

People like Tolkien, Rowling and Gaiman.

Here’s what I learned:

***

"What happens next?"

Neil Gaiman says you can sum up great storytelling with those 3 words.

They should be the first thing a reader (or listener) says if the story is stopped at any point.

***

Start with the end in mind

What do you want the outcome of your story to be?

• Reader falling in love with a character
• Customer buying a product
• Friend laughing hilariously
• Investor giving you money

If you start with the end in mind, the intro and middle naturally funnel to that target.

***

Shape your story

Humans gravitate to structure. Luckily there are tons to wrap around your story:

• Hero’s Journey
• StoryBrand
• Three Act

The goal of a story structure is to let the characters shine through.

The attached image is the actual plot outline JK Rowling created for the 5th Harry Potter.

***

Lead with action

Most people amble on in backstory for 10 minutes.

This is a waste of time.

Find the interesting parts of your story, jump right to it, and provide as little backstory as possible.

***

“But, therefore”

The creators of South Park use a simple heuristic.

If the word “And” fits into the transitions in your story, it’s probably boring.

Aim to use more “But” or “Therefore.”

They imply conflict, change, and tension.

***

Build a world

Tolkien said: 

“The story maker proves a successful sub-creator. They make a secondary world which your mind can enter.”

A few tips to create your world:

• Use rituals
• Define its laws
• Create shared language (you don’t need to create a brand new language like Tolkien did!)

Think about all the words you learned from the Harry Potter world: muggle, the spells, dementor, and many more.

Storytelling is how you introduce people to the world you’ve built.

***

Slow down

Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in.

When speaking, stop talking for 3 seconds.

When writing, make your paragraphs longer, add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.

Force your audience to hang on to every word.

***

Build to one moment

The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment.

But what is the moment about?

Change — I once was this, but now I’m this.

***

Develop your own creative process

JK Rowling uses outlines. Stephen King doesn’t.

Neil Gaiman writes every day. George RR Martin doesn’t.

Brandon Sanderson writes best at 11pm. William Faulkner at 9am.

The lesson? Do you, but be consistent.
