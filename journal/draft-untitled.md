A random guy used to come up to us on the street. In a city of 1.5 million people, it may seem unlikely to encounter the same person twice, but there stood my friend and I, trying to figure out how this guy we didn't know kept running into us. It was our first year at college and our first time living in a city. But we knew enough to know it was weird. He didn't start a conversation mid-sentence, ask us for money or help, or apologize for skipping over the whole "I know you don't know me and this is weird" part. He just walked up to us friendly as could be, said "hey guys!" like we were classmates, and asked us what we were up to. He then proceeded to tell us about what he was doing, remarked about how we should hang out, and attempted to barnacle his way onto whatever it was my friend and I were on our way to do. We successfully fended him off with one excuse or another, but this happened four of five times until the winds changed and we never saw him again. He seemed a fraction older than us, maybe early twenties. He was too put together to peg as crazy, but too forward to be considered normal (fix this word later). 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
