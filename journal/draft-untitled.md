The Gift of Being Oblivious
Are you aggrieved if you don't know it? (work on the subtitle)

"Hey...I saw the emails. How are you holding up? Are you ok? I can't believe he did that."

Hmm. 

What the hell is she talking about?

As I settle across the table from one of my professors to review the plan for an upcoming project, she lobs a sad, heartfelt, empathetic ball of pity my way. I catch it but I have no idea what sport we're playing, so I hesitate while I figure out if I should dribble it, kick it, or pass it back to her.

"Oh yeah, I'm fine. It's not a big deal."

People often say "I'm fine. It's not a big deal" to change the subject and avoid talking about the pain they feel. But sitting at this tiny table in this tiny conference room, there's no pain to speak of. Across from me, however, is the fifth person to broach this topic unprovoked in the last week. So it's starting to sink in I may have been wronged in some way. Apparently, I had a heated reply-all email conversation with one of the other professors the previous week about some logistical decisions for a class project. One problem: I didn't know it was heated. 

I knew it was _somewhat_ contentious because we were at odds over the decision and I didn't back down right away, but I thought it a reasonable exchange of opinions the result of which was going with his idea. Hence my stance of "no big deal". Also, I know how reply-all works. If I noticed either of us stepping over the line, I would have simply taken the conversation out of view of the rest of the class. But I didn't. And neither did he. 



<!-- And now I'm being peppered in the hallways with looks of concern like I'm limping around with a fox trap snapped around my ankle. -->

I didn't step in a goddamn fox trap. 


What AM I SAYINGGGGG?? Being oblivious saved me from feeling wronged. (This piece is turning into me being annoyed that others were concerned for me when I didn't have a problem with it. Stop it.)







Let's look at the facts. My professor is shitty to me in a public email conversation as evidenced by the reaction of class members and faculty who read it. I'm oblivious to this and therefore unaffected. I'm quite fond of this professor and I we're pretty close as teacher-pupil relationships go. And it's in this last fact we find how things like this happen. 


Two things are true. One: my professor was shitty to me in a public email conversation, as evidenced by the reaction of class members and faculty who read it. Two: I was oblivious to this and therefore unaffected.

Two more things are true. One: I was quite fond of this professor. Two: We were close, and always on good terms.

The latter are crucial to understanding how something like this might happen. 

- It was a class-wide chain with reply-alls for every message, so every time I entered into conversation in the hallway, classmates and even professors brought up how bad they felt for me at being treated so poorly in the conversation. I shrugged it off, not really understanding what the big deal was.
- I was quite fond of the professor and he was a bit eccentric, so I gave him an unscalable mountain of behavioral leash (find the better word for this analogy, leash conflicts)
- The difference in perspective that [leash] gave me is an essay unto itself, but in essense it allowed my already substantial naivete and obliviousness to cloud the truth even more.
- When a third professor brought it up unprovoked in a one-on-one meeting, I finally got it. Sort of.
- Skipping ahead

- This is not new behavior for me.
- Talk about getting rejected in middle school by a classmate you asked out. Talk about how it was a tiny class and a tiny school and everyone knew that she lied to avoid hanging out with me, but I didn't.
- Talk about how even when I knew, I didn't think there was anything particularly egregious about it. And that she and I joked about it while waiting for the bus one afternoon. 
- (as I'm thinking of it, I think we joked about the fact that people said she lied, and I brought that up, and she pulled the ol' "whaaaaaaaat?" and we both scoffed at the obvious truth)
- But even though I used willful ignorance in that moment to believe her, I knew it was true. And I rationalized it away and gave her credit for making something up to protect my feelings. I mean, what would I have done?

- This part goes into the Marcus Aurelius portion of the program. No one else can tell me how I should feel about something. I have to choose how I feel. And being oblivious in this way is an exceptional tool if my goal is to avoid allowing external forces to influence my mental wellbeing.
- The opposite of paranoia is obliviousness. The paranoid hear everything, whether it's said or not. The oblivious hear nothing, no matter how much is said. Which one would I rather be? 
- I'd like to think I'm so cerebral that at 12 I could compartmentalize the brutal rejection of a girl I liked, allowing me to float along as if nothing happened. But my cerebellum was probably too busy thinking about baseball cards, candy, and Nintendo to even notice. It turns out, as evidenced by my encounter with the savagely condescending email chain from my professor in college, I have a preternatural ability to be completely oblivious to insults.

- Next part, talking about how useful that is, but it comes at a deadly cost if the abuse is consistent. Maybe draw out the usefulness part, see how much ground I can cover with that. Then talk a little more briefly about the costs. Drive home how practicing this can lower the bar for being offended, allowing higher levels of focus toward the things that really matter. i,e, I dont' NEED to care about people being critical of me if my aims are toward the good and I work on putting good in the world. If I'm NOT clean (read: pure), the criticism SHOULD hurt, because I'm not acting in a manner that will benefit myself, my loved ones, my community, and the world.
- Otherwise, who fuggin cares? <-- this may need some refinement lolz

- (This might be for later) The piece of glue holding this concept together is the fact that I wasn't made to feel wrong or foolish for choosing apathy over outrage. When I got rejected, I got some uncharacteristic credit for putting myself out on a limb, one usually critical classmate even stating "I don't think _I'd_ have the guts to ask anyone out". And in the case of the email exchange, all I got were empathetic gestures of condolence from anyone who spoke to me about it.
- This was a luxury, and I believe it's one of the contributing factors permitting me to make my own choice regarding how I reacted. Which is a curious reality. Why should I allow someone else's feelings dictate how I feel about something happening to me, not them? But this part of our social makeup is important to help us avoid being victims of a _pattern_ of abuse. (not sure where this part is taking me, but wanted to get it down)


Notes: passive voice is all over this, make sure that gets cleaned up

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
