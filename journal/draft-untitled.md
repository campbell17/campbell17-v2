Economics has no place in emotional decisions. 

Unfortunately, some of our most emotional decisions are financial hammers, and we drop them on our thumbs without a second thought. What we drive and where we sleep are decisions rooted almost entirely in irrational fantasy. A humanoid AI whose prime objective is long-term financial stability would spend no more than $2,500 on any car and drive it until repairing it was literally impossible, then repeat that process until the end of time. Why? Math. But math doesn't sell cars, so advertising is positioned to appeal to our feelings instead of our brains. Even when we know the math, our dumbass hearts invent every bias imaginable to trick our brains into justifying a less responsible purchase.

Even the most frugal among us still land quite a few shades more emotional on the decision spectrum than our robotic benchmark. But this is what makes life worth living. We get to play. And daydreaming about our dream house or putting a poster of a Porsche 959 on our wall as a teenager are playful acts. We only run into problems when we don't learn the ability to understand when it's time to play in real life. Barring the generationally wealthy, most of us play too much before we can afford it. 

<!-- NOTES: Where am I going with this? I'm not sure. We're not build for cold, calculated practicality. If we were, there would be no art, music, or amusement of any kind, because those things cost money. But we're not humanoids. We're humans. And long-term financial stability, while important to people who understand how this world works, isn't the only objective. But can we have more than one prime objective? Isn't the word prime defined as singular? -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
