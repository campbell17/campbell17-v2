Someone once paid me an innocent compliment that made me question my life and the lives of everyone else. Not counting sociopaths and narcissists, though there are plenty of them around, most adults I meet are fairly self-depricating, measured, and humble. Sometimes I have the privilege of spending enough time with someone to push beyond simple cocktail party small-talk. This, by the way, can last indefinitely depending on the level of affinity and chemistry between people. I've had neighbors I talked to nearly every day for a year and never got beyond yesterday's football scores. This kind of social limbo can be excrutiating when I'm not a fan of the other person. I didn't dislike them, per se, but I'd sooner let those dead skin-eating fish[1] loose on my face than have dinner with the guy. But I digress. If we hit it off, we might exchange info about our hobbies, number of children, favorite vacation spots, and so on. After that, though, my brain fills in the blanks of the rest of their life story with a series of defaults based on _my_ experience, not theirs. This is perfectly understandable since that's how the brain negotiates the complexity of living, assigning placeholder data based on our assumptions and biases. But twenty years ago I crossed paths with someone who, with one comment, snapped a new perspective into my consciousness.

Most of the time, 

[1] Garra rufa. Yes, I googled "fish that eat dead skin". Buyer beware, apparently.

Outline and notes for next time: NOTE: Be careful about diminishing the other person while propping yourself up

Talk about how most of the time when I gain a realization about someone, it's the other person. But in this case, it was about me. It blew my mind, but maybe I don't have to say that explicitly.

- Story teaser
- Intro to my perception of people
- Intro to my perception of me
- Surprise to hear that someone thought my life was full - this is incongruous to how I view myself (figure out me's vs. myselfs for this)
- Realization that in order to pay me such a compliment, there must be high contrast between my experiences and that of the compliment giver
- Something about how such a tiny remark has such wide and lasting impact due to it's misalignment with the image of self
- "Oh, she just doesn't realize I'm a lazy piece of shit yet. Once she got to know me, she wouldn't think my life was so full."
- But maybe I shouldn't take the experiences I've had for granted as much as I do. Not everyone is as lucky or has the freedoms and opportunities I have
