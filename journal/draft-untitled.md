- Something I didn't expect about getting older is my growing intuition regarding tradeoffs. When I was younger, I still maintained the naive belief that the concept of free was real. (cut from "I don't love it")
    - This initial skepticism opens up more opportunity to be pleasantly surprised when something _is_ actually a "good deal"
    - Something about my kids thinking they could upgrade their phones for free because the mobile advertising always talks about "upgrade every year". Yes, they allow you to upgrade, but all that means is they'll take your old phone and give you a pittance toward another phone, meaning you're still out of pocket hundreds.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
