November 17, 2013. Austin, Texas.

At 2:43pm, Sebastian Vettel takes the chequered flag at the United States Grand Prix, setting a new record for most consecutive Formula One wins in a season and putting an exclamation point on his fourth consecutive World Championship title. As he cools the car and waves to the crowd on the meandering lap back into the pits, he pulls into a run-off area to perform some celebratory donuts in his Red Bull RB9. In the moments preceding this display, he sends out a radio call to his team:

| We have to remember these days, we have to remember these days, because there's no guarantee that they will last forever. Enjoy them as long as they last. I love you guys.

If you've ever heard record-setting athletes interviewed about their success, they always say some version of, "I just try to take things one [race, game, match] at a time and let others focus on the records. Maybe I'll look back on them when I'm older, but right now I'm focused on doing the best job I can." And this makes sense. You can't exactly murder your competition if you're spending time with your head in the clouds, admiring all your achievements. 100% of your focus has to be on, you know, the murdering. Which is why I was shocked when I heard Vettel, who was only 26 at the time, heave all that wise perspective over the radio. And as the years followed and dominance in the sport shifted to the Mercedes team, his outpouring of gratitude that day seems even more prophetic. That race was not his final win, but that season turned out to be his final championship-winning effort. (maybe cut this?)Knowing this, I get inexplicably emotional when I revisit his quote. It's the same feeling of satisfaction I get when a key unlocks a door or a puzzle piece fits.

I will not ever know Vettel's level of success. You - you, reading this now - will also never know success like that. But the reverence he managed to recognize during the pilgrimage of his career is not so untouchable to us, the unwashed masses. 

<!-- Notes for next time 2: Got the transition, now go into the tiny slices and how to be grateful. Don't just brag, maybe show how-to?  -->
<!-- Notes for next time 1: Those sentiments came at the end of an unprecedented run of success, but they apply to even the smallest slice of time.  -->

- Cherishing the in-betweens
    - Recognize and soak in the minutes of true freedom
        - The first 5 minutes of coming home from Lowes, pretzel in my hand, windows open
        - Sebastian Vettel doing donuts after his 4th and final world championship (use this as the intro, also check that it was his 4th and not 3rd)


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
