I keep my cars. I know people who are unattached to theirs, like it's a pair of jeans or something. For them, it's just a car, and I guess their desire for something newer or different is greater than their affinity for what they already have. But I get very attached to mine. Every time I get a different car, I believe I'll have it until it dies of natural causes, old, creaky, and decrepit. But every time, external circumstances force me to give up my precious before I'm ready. Next month my current car turns 11. I don't celebrate the car's birthday like some lunatic, but when I thought about its age I was reminded of the last time my car met an untimely end and, more specifically, the ride we took in the tow truck that night.

A tow truck is one of those services we hope we never need. It's a last resort-based business model. Like going number two in public or [add a second amusing example], it's something most people go to great lengths to avoid. On a stormy Florida night in the summer of 2013, I drove my oldest son to get his hair cut before we all left for vacation the next day. As we rounded the final turn off the main road, my hatchback, which was fitted with a modified intake from its previous owner, sloshed through a flooded section of road that was imperceptably deep. The aftermarket intake, mounted low to the ground to suck in air that was cooler than that of the heat-soaked engine bay, took a choking gulp of rainwater instead. Realizing what was about to happen, I tried to kill the engine before any damage was done, but after we got out and pushed the car into the gas station adjacent to the giant puddle, it wouldn't restart. I suspected (https://www.wiki.com)[hydrolock], but the diagnosis would have to wait. In the meantime, I checked my phone for the nearest tow service.

<!-- Notes for next time: The driver and his story is the story. His many kids, the conversation about the popularity of big families on reality tv, and his fervent stance on keeping his privacy. This is what stuck with me. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
