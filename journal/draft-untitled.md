What is your personal WAR?

WAR, not to be confused with war, stands for Wins Above Replacement and is a term used in baseball statistics to evaluate a player's supposed value over a ficticious replacement player of average abilities. While some baseball nerds argue over its accuracy like actual nerds argue over the pronunciation of GIF, the concept provoked a train of thought recently while I was daydreaming about my life. Do I behave in a manner that would bring about a void if I disappeared? More to the point, how big is that void?

Let's look at the opposite side. And let's lower the stakes from people to...let's say cats. My cat is an asshole. She didn't used to be this way, but she's getting old so her cuteness levels have dropped and her shitting-on-the-carpet levels have skyrocketed. 

<!-- Notes: How am I impacting the lives of the people I'm close to? What about acquaintences? Coworkers? Strangers? Am I there for the people around me compared to the average schmuck? -->



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
