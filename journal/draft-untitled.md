- There's a pattern of behavior that causes me to try very hard, with earnest intention and intense motivation, and just when I get pretty good at whatever I'm trying, I stop improving. The resistance that comes along with the final 10-20% of improvement is so thick that it is far more comfortable to tread water than grab for that next gear and grind my way into excellence.
- I'm a huge proponent of "good enough". My entire life is so saturated with _good enough_, I'm considering commissioning a half-finished statue with no upper body adorned with "This'll Do" on the placard. - There are varying standards for what constitutes a passable level of aptitude. For instance, I wouldn't want my heart surgeon to subscribe to my "good enough" lifestyle, but it's plenty for a golfing buddy.
- But there's something painful to admit about this stuff: I don't think I've ever hit even 80% (athletics don't count any more since I'm physiologically/physically limited. In my youth, athletics counted since I never once strength trained, so I have no idea what my limits were.)
- I'm very familiar with the feeling of quitting while I'm ahead. Too familiar. Run just fast enough to avoid being the slowest bear attack victim.
- Alain Prost vs. Ayrton Senna
- Get good enough so I rarely receive the fish eye in day to day life.
- But sometimes I run into someone who's humming along at a much higher level and now the questions start to pop up.
- This is one of the rare times when a little comparison to others can help me reacquire the GPS signal on the learning curve. "Oh shit, I'm further from 90% than I wanted to know..."
- But what about diminishing returns? What do those look like?
- I usually stop when I can do the job well enough for others not to question it.
- In personal work, I'm the only one who's available to question things, so this approach can hamper my ceiling.
- The balance between improvement and...what's the phrase for spending too much time on something because I'm unlikely to get any better at it no matter the time spent. Diminishing returns, but not that.
- When I first start, it's panic mode and rapid improvement is a need. As I get better, that panic and subsequent hunger abates. 
- Comfort and complacence are two sides of the same coin. On one side, that's what all this initial hard work is for. "I work really hard so I can be lazy" is the mentality. I think this has potential but the scale has to be correct. For example, I don't think I'd want to burn myself out for 30 years and then sit on my ass for 50. "How many margaritas on the beach can I have before I want to jump off a bridge from the meaninglessness?" But I might be able to scale that all the way down to the day. Bust my ass between the whistles and be free to stare at the wall until bedtime. Scale that up to the week, and I can bust my ass on weekdays and do leisurely stuff on weekends. Yes, I might want to bust my ass "doing leisure", but it's a different kind.
- The other side of the comfort coin, though, is coasting. We've already been over the damage coasting can do (this might be worded incorrectly, but relate it to the earlier essay), and when the hunger to improve wilts, the things I found great meaning in before are rendered unfulfilling. What's worse, subsequent lack of effort will cause the quality of output to fall below what I'm capable of.

Notes for tomorrow: When is it ok to stop? Is it ok to stop? How my placement on the curn relates to specific goals.


Cut from "Dangerous Territory" essay:

Gaining proficiency in any area involves three stages. Initially, we have zero clue so progress is slow and resembles fishing around in the kitchen junk drawer in total darkness. In some cases we can't remember what we're fishing for or why we even entered the kitchen in the first place. There's even a chance we prick our finger on a rogue pushpin and bail on the entire enterprise. Stage two starts when we figure those things out and start making progress hand over fist. We spend a lot of time here and it's difficult to determine how high up the mountain we are. Rabbit holes are often disguised as breakthroughs and sometimes when we turn over a stone to uncover an answer, we get 5 more stones along with it. Finally, after hundreds if not thousands of hours, the rate of improvement tapers off and we're free to spend the rest of eternity chasing mastery in stage three. Most people don't make it to stage three. Stage three is for Olympians only, which makes sense if you do the math. If achieving 90% competence takes 1,000 hours, getting that last 10% could take fifty times as long, if you ever capture it at all. So would I really want to spend 12 years getting ten percent when it took 12 weeks to get ninety?
