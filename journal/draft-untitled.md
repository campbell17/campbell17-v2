Nothing changes if nothing changes.

Yesterday I yelled at Sebastian for not listening and not doing what I told him to do. He hates getting yelled at. When the dust settled, I had him sit next to me for an excrutiating (for him) conversation about what we might do differently next time to avoid the yelling. He admitted to understanding my instructions and recognized he had multiple chances to do what I asked before the yelling commenced. We pinpointed the precise moment my asking turned into yelling so he could recognize the threshold between the two. And he understood why there have to be consequences for behavior that falls outside of acceptible parameters. And yet...

I could not get him to commit to changing his behavior to prevent getting yelled at the next time this happened. And there will always be a next time. After all the digging to uncover the root cause, all the exposition about the rules of civilized human reparte, and all the irrefutable logic laid before him, he still wanted to keep his options open. I have to commend his foresight. He knows agreeing to a set of boundaries now limits his ability to wriggle his way out of trouble on technical grounds in the future. And his carnal need for autonomy evidently trumps his disdain for my yelling. Time to look inward.

I put him through the exercise of root cause analysis for our conflict, but I didn't fully explore my side of the equation. I must figure out what I can offer that is so disagreeable he would zestfully jettison his beloved autonomy to avoid it. Like all elegant solutions, it should have second and third-order benefits. For example, instead of yelling, I can calmly force him to clean his room every time he doesn't do what I ask. If he's smart, which he is, he'll eventually come to the realization that keeping his room clean at all times negates this punishment completely. He avoids traumatic yelling, we get a cleaner room in the house, and he minimizes the effects of the penance the cleaner his room stays. The only problem with an example like this is the diminishing returns on pain. He would undoubtedly return to the homeostasis of not listening as soon as the sting of discipline fell below the autonomy-need threshold. This doesn't mean it's not worth pursuing, however. Rather, I'll have to seek out other sophisticated alternatives to yelling that also achieve mutually profitable outcomes.

<!-- Notes for next time: The concept of cutting your nose off to spite your face. Tell the story about sitting at the cool kids lunch table and listening to them try to get out of doing an assignment. Then naively suggesting that the effort requred to get out of the work was more than the work itself. Something my parents taught me. That was hilariously wrong to them. But I knew it was right. Also, start exploring your sister's attitude toward changing the thing that needs to be changed, and how looking externally will always become chasing dragons sooner or later. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
