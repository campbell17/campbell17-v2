Stuck in the space between people who went further before they stopped and people who never started.

I thought I wanted to be a racing driver. I did want to be a racing driver. But I didn't want it _enough_.

How do I know this? I went to racing school. At the school there were instructors. These instructors also wanted to be professional racing drivers. And in a sense, they already were. They got paid some amount of money to teach other people the craft of racing. They made it further than me, but still hadn't "made it". One instructor made it as far one level below the top. Indy Lights.

At the school, the instructors would often take a group of students in a regular passenger car around the track and talk through the nuances of the line, the strategy, and the logistics of racing. In one such ride, it came up in coversation that the instructor had spent half a season last year in Indy Lights. I asked him, "why not a full season?" Still in my late teens, I was naive and thought maybe some extinuating circumstances torpedoed his campaign. I was shocked by the cold practical reality of his answer:

"Money."

As he hit the braking zone into turn 1, the conversation hushed. I wasn't sure if I made a faux pas by asking or if I'd accidentally given everyone the secret code to why they, and everyone they will ever know, will never make it all the way to the top. We were being driven around by the best of the 5 incredible instructors there that weekend, a man who spent thousands of hours on track including at the professional level, and even he couldn't conjure all the pieces together to reach the goal. Maybe for him, more money would have been the tipping point. Up the ladder he would have gone until one day I'd be watching him spraying champagne on the podium and I'd turn to my kids and say, "See that guy? He used to teach me how to race."

I didn't progress beyond "racing student". I didn't want it enough. The instructors wanted it bad enough to push their careers hard in that direction, such that they became teachers of the craft the loved and practiced. Some stopped there. Others went on to race sports cars in various series' not considered part of the upper echelon, and maybe that was just fine with them. 

I always grapple with the worthiness of my level. I didn't make it past the 2 racing school tiers I attended. Because "Money". But I did want it enough to obsess over the idea enough to attend the school in the first place. But racing is one thing in a long list of things I got higher than level 0 at but didn't go much further. How should I feel about this? "However I want" is one answer. "However I choose" is the correct answer. 

I see this advice everywhere: Don't compare yourself to others. It sounds good, and I'm sure it does wonders to tamp down unnecesary mismatches in expectations, not to mention quelling our inherent propensity for jealousy. But we're comparison _machines_. It's unrealistic to pretend we're not going to compare ourselves to our peers as well as those most publicly successful at the things we wish we were good at. But comparison is a two step process involving the exercise and the aftermath. To me, the exercise is primal. We can avoid it as much as possible, but there's no eradicating it. THe aftermath - what we do about the results of said comparison - is under our complete control.

The third and final time I raced a single seater was a matter of personal pride. I mentioned two tiers of racing school. The second tier didn't go well. The carpenter never blames his tools, so I'll blame myself for not asking for the pedals to be adjusted, but my foot kept slipping off the brake after the long straight at Road America and I ended up stuck in the gravel trap twice. It felt like a wasted opportunity and had me questioning everything. Remember, up to that point I thought I was on the path to becoming a racing driver - a truly kindergarten ambition, if we're honest. But after being strapped to that Dodge Ram and towed out of the kitty litter again, self-doubt consumed me.

Months later, the school offered a test day at the newly resurfaced Mont Tremblant circuit in Montreal. Typically their test days were split into halves, so you could either sign up for a morning session or an afternoon session, but they offered this day as a double session for the same price. The school also didn't time their half-day sessions. Drivers would show up and do as many laps as they could, getting some track-side instruction from the staff throughout. But on this day, all cars would get readouts of their lap times. After the disappointment and shame of my performance the last time, I couldn't shake the desire to find out whether or not that was a fluke. Even if I never did another lap after this, I had to know. The track was about two hours northwest of Montreal. It was an 8 hour drive from my parent's house New Jersey.

Next: booking accommodations. Sometimes not knowing anything works out. A B&B? Sure. I had no idea that it wasn't a hotel. 



Next time: the writing above is horrible and trite. Please fix this before shipping. The point I'm making is I had to prove it to myself that my poor performance was a fluke, so months later I blah blah now I get to tell the cool story about driving up to Montreal and doing the double session where I topped the time sheets. Yay me. How do I keep doing this without self-aggrandizing my VERY limited achievements?



- one thing useful is to compare down after comparing up

- There's an objective truth out there, though. Denying it isn't the purpose of these practices. I don't want to go around making tons of mistakes, then shrug my shoulders and say, "That was a disaster, but I sure learned a lot". 

- 



Perhaps a more useful mantra is "compare but don't care". 

What do we need for a balanced perspective? Two points of view. 



Lt. Nathaniel Fick:
Most people in America right now think of Iraq as a dangerous country. Now, if I were to stand up, I might get killed. But to us, behind this wheel it's pretty safe. So to us, Iraq is a safe country. Right here, I feel pretty safe. Do you feel safe?

Evan 'Scribe' Wright:
Pretty safe, I guess.

Lt. Nathaniel Fick:
See? It's all relative.



Next time: What am I saying? This: Racing is one thing in a long list of things I got higher than level 0 at but didn't go much further. How should I feel about this? Should I feel good that I publish a weekly essay even when I hate what I wrote? I'm in the arena, I guess. And I was in the arena when I was racing. It's pointless to compare, but can it give perspective? When I feel awful about what I'm doing, shouldn't the fact that I'm DOING be all I need to know to set my mind at ease?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
