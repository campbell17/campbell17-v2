Natural Life Enhancement

- We've all heard some form of the expression, "that'll take years off your life." But what about the opposite?

- There are different ways to accelerate your death. The activities you practice, the fuel you choose to intake, and the company you keep all have different grit levels. The worse for your health, the coarser the grit, the more longevity it strips away.

- We have agency over our activities and fuel, but sometimes we don't put enough stock in the company we keep. We're surrounded, but who are these people? Do they strip away at your life or do they add to it?

- Likewise, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind of person who adds stress to others? (strengthen the hell out of this)



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
