Wild hairs

Why is TODAY the day?

When does something I want to do get moved into the "something I'm doing" bucket?

I want to do x, and I know at some point I will, but when _now_ is the moment I refuse to wait another day...why? Why is TODAY the day?

- My old photography professor used to say, there are a million reasons _not_ to do something. He said this in reference to the lack of seriousness his students often displayed when it came to motivation, procrastination, and deadlines.
- Shamon. Staple some nuts on. That wasn't my professor's quote, rather an old colleague, but that was my professor's implied next sentence. Get out of your own ass and do the work.
- The point is, there ARE a million reasons not to do something. So what does it take to finally silence those voices and staple on our proverbial nuts? 
- I love the phrase "forcing function" because it succinctly describes the mechanism through which progress is born. If I'm standing next to a stranger at the bus stop, the possibilities for what needs to happen next are completely up in the air. I may strike up a conversation, pull out my phone to see if I have any notifications to clear, or stick my hands in my armpits and smell them because I got nervous. But what if I'm at the bus stop and a stranger collapses on the ground? That event eliminates every possibility except one: "Hey. _Tend to that._"
- Some forcing functions, like the collapsing stranger, emerge out of thin air...


Notes for next time: continue the last sentence, talking about external forces becoming forcing functions. Then move on to lists, top 5 stuff, and maybe other types of motivations. What happens when something just dies on the vine, never to get done?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
