- Kicking over trash cans and opening mail boxes
    - Compare to modern "wrongdoing"...it's easy to spot a trash can askew, but what if the kids are shitposting online?

When I was bike riding age, my friend and I decided it'd be fun to ride around the neighborhood kicking over people's trash cans and opening their mail boxes. A reasonable assumption for a kid in elementary school, I think...

Notes: This is a story about doing fun things that are wrong, and how the challenge of spotting these events from a parents' perspective has changed for this generation of online-only kids.


Have you ever done something fun that was objectively wrong? If you're a human being, we already know the answer. The human condition encourages this. The foundation of fun is the concept of play, an activity in which only humans and (find out how many other species) participate. Play is (something fundamental to us) and those who don't do it are resigned to be not fully formed <- this is horrendous but true, fix the writing. A building block of play is risk. And it's the separation of risk and wrongdoing that determines how sustainable our brand of fun is. Skiing is risky because it's physically dangerous. But it's fun for the same reason. And the fun increases as the risk does, but only up to a point. (get back to this point somehow?) But what if every time I finished my run I raced to the bottom and sprayed the people in the lift line with snow as I stopped? That could be fun for me, but not for them. When we go ice skating, my youngest son always asks me to do a hot lap while he takes a seat on the bench and waits for me to hockey-stop into the open door, showering him with snow. The other parents are always horrified until he giggles and commands me to do it again. So if I filled the lift line with a crowd of willing participants, a healthy snowing wouldn't be wrong.

It's remarkable how sticky some memories are. Once when I was riding bikes with a friend, we decided to have some extra fun. It was trash day, a concept I didn't yet know existed, and the empty cans of everyone in the neighborhood were still loitering at the end of their driveways. We thought it would be fun to strafe these poor defenseless bins, kicking them to the pavement as we coasted by on our bikes. They crashed and bounced to the ground with an echoing boom. It was such a satisfying sound, we did the whole street. Halfway through, we added a twist. Let's open all these mailboxes, too. On we went, open-kick, pedal pedal, kick-open, pedal pedal, kick-kick (this family had two cans) open...

(as mom about how word got back to her - did I tell because I didn't think it was wrong?)

Word got back to mom, and she reintroduced me to the idea of empathy, a.k.a. the golden rule. 

This was life before the internet. 

Wrongdoing as a recreational activity was primarily confined to that which could be seen by any interested onlooker. Prank phone calls aside, no mischief was possible without paying the "is anybody looking" tax. The specter of a human being seeing us do something wrong, on purpose and in person, was a natural barrier to entry in the _Being a Troll_ game. This makes the modern would-be can-kickers more vulnerable to mischief's allure thrice over. Once because of the inherent anonymity of the internet. Twice because the phones in our pockets mean not only do we not have to leave the house, but we can shitpost our angst upon unsuspecting strangers from the comfort of the spare bathroom. And thrice because there's zero external recourse even from the most attentive (and technically talented) parents.

I _am_ technically talented, and locking down my son's phone was still fiddly and frought with trial and error. Also, _his friends all have phones_. Short of starting a neighborhood parenting club where we all agree to the same level of psychopathic ankle-braceleting of our kids' devices, we're powerless to see let alone stop a pattern of negative behavior before it becomes their default.

Maybe it's just me being old and old fashioned, but 





(where I'm going with this is, putting other people out can also be fun, but if it isn't their idea/they're not part of it, it's wrong.) 



Notes: After you explain this better, move on to "This one time at band camp" and tell the story about the cans and boxes. Then compare the obviousness of that being wrong with the obfuscation of the wrongness of certain social media habits? Let's see where that goes.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
