Everyone has nice headings with all kinds of words. I noticed I get more views on longer posts, not because the quality is better, but because it takes people more than one sitting to read the whole thing and that artificailly pumps up the numbers. If my most ardent readers open the essay 5 times, that's 5 views. 18 people on average read my essays, so each one should be getting 40% open rate and 18 views. The open rate is steady at between 35 and 40%, but the views spike and settle. Only recently did it occur to me that the spiking is based on the mechanics of the measurement and not the content of the piece being measured. I find it hard to write for a sustained hour unless I'm cramming to ship. I also have zero movement on new subscribers because I've put zero effort into increasing the number. 

If I wanted an excuse, I could say I wanted to get a good baseline for what moves that needle, and that now it's clear the writing alone doesn't do it. But everything I've read about Substack and growth therein has told me the same. That I have to comment meaningful things on others' posts, advertise myself, get the word out, and so on. I've been reluctant to do that because I'm afraid of the rejection after all the effort. If I get rejected now (i.e. no one new subscribes) I can pass it off as "well I'm not even trying, so obviously that's why". But if I try my heart out, tell everyone I know, bark at strangers on the internet to care, and still no one does, that feeling of rejection will cut deeper and possibly undermine my ability to continue. 

So maybe I'm waiting until I have a deep muscle memory built up that skips any thoughts creeping in about these things. That would be too easy. John Mayer on a recent podcast talked about fighting through the fear that never goes away. Even for someone as talented and accomplished as he, the fear never goes away. What separates the people who grow from those who don't is the resilience to ship and ship again even after being rejected. And to never stop, regardless. It has to leave the realm of decision-making and enter a space of pure drive, like the main character in There Will Be Blood. He wasn't motivated by conscious thoughts, save for those he used to scheme...he was simply driven to action by his instincts like a wolf to a hunt. 



I hadn't considered this. A fox dashes through the yard. A houselight flickers across the street. Two birds engage in boisterous conflict. 

Attemps to quiet my mind fail. I move on to something else. Something less real. It's been said that it isn't until words are spoken that they can be made a song. 

A muffled cough. The click and hum of the furnace igniting. The sound of rushing of air dominates the room. A short interruption for a kiss goodbye. It's right on time.

We soon face a future alone. Before was only the idea of the horrors and triumphs behind the curtain, and having faced its reality we can't go back, nor would we. Those days weren't better, else I never would have left them behind. Until the new journey of aloneness comes, we impart what we can, where we can, when we can. Most won't find land. Nature is always a step ahead, erecting misleading waypoints. But we entered into this agreement willingly and of sound mind, so we try.

Snow fell last night. The tiny flakes are the ones that stick. I tried to salt but the bag was too heavy so it splashed in clumps I had to kick aside. I underestimated how much I missed winter in the years I spent away. I dreamt of returning, but had to wait. Something came up. Then another. Then two more. The time was never right. But I was content to stay, sensing it covetous to dream. I dreamt anyway.

The landscape meditates under fresh snow and all stray sounds seem to hibernate. Entropy will steal this purity away and I absorb it while I can so it doesn't go to waste. There's a hidden line I don't want to cross that goes from appreciation to indulgence. The cost of gluttony is the steady, unrecoverable diminishment of wonder. I have things to do, anyway, so I move on.

Painful things are in store. They're not the only thing for sale, but they always come as the free gift. It strikes me as odd that we sometimes choose them specifically. We ask for them by name. In many cases we even subscribe without the slightest clue how to cancel. Tomorrow's problem, you see. These things are not to be avoided. They are not to be chased away. They're the medicine we must take if we have an aim. We must have an aim. A good, worthy, defensible aim. If it serves only us, as art does, its byproduct must be at least an artifact somehow new to the world, if only because we are its author. Without aim, the pain cannot act out its true purpose.

When the snow melted, the sky remained grey. Where we expected renewal, there was none. Where we looked for growth, we saw none. The action of spring remained still until we granted hope an early death. Now we seek not to help but to merely satisfy our curiosities. 

But when I woke up today I saw sunlight coming through the trees. I hadn't considered this.


<!-- Older version -->
What will happen to us when the kids move out? Do we go back to our lives of free love and no committments? The era before kids is like a time before consciousness. There was only the idea of the horrors and triumphs behind the curtain, not the reality. When the reality is over, we can't go back. Nor do we wish to. The old days weren't better, else they would remain.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
