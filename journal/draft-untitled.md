What was I talking about? Oh yeah, the BnB.

I arrived at night to the ski town of Mont Tremblant. My passenger seat was empty, save for an empty [specific food wrapper], a [something second], and the wrinkled inkjet pages scrawled with MapQuest's finest navigations. I could tell the pedestrians glancing through my windshield knew I didn't know where I was or where I was going. I could just _tell_. It was after 10pm and I was surprised how busy the town was. I always forgot other people actually like to leave the house once in a while. It was a fools hope to be invisible in a car with a cracked windshield, a dented quarter-panel, and New Jersey plates. I was hard on my little Integra.

Some watched me pass without looking, as one does in conversation between rounds of eye contact. I crawled along between stop signs looking for my turn. The light of the town faded as I left it far behind me. Normally, fear of the darkening path would lead my mind to wander into thoughts of getting stopped along the road somehow, overpowered and subdued by a burly man of the bush, and chopped into meaty chunks via off-season snowblower. But this was Canada. The worst they would do is offer me their worst maple syrup as a cruel joke, not knowing it was still better than what I could get at home. With warm Belgian waffles now dominating my subconscious, I saw my turn pass without a hint of a throttle-lift. I slowed to initiate a U-turn without stopping, afraid my syrup-laden fantasies would prove an overestimate of Hoser hospitality.

The sound of a car coming up the gravel road coupled with the unfilled entry in his logbook stirred the owner of this remote Bed & Breakfast enough to turn on the light above the entrance door. Looking at the humble sign next to the humble side-door, I opened the car door to the sobering understanding that a hotel and a Bed & Breakfast are not the same thing. A fact made only more real by the very real and clearly puzzled older couple who answered my knock on their door. Their puzzlement puzzled me, as I would have thought these kinds of things went with the territory of proprieting accommodations for strangers for a living. But as this was my first exposure to the world of non-chain-hotel travel arrangements, my guesses are as follows: (1) They normally do not receive guests this late. By the time I relieved my overworked and underappreciated 1.8 liter 4 cylinder Honda engine for the night, she'd been revving through the gears and droning on the interstate for 10 hours, cementing my arrival at a few minutes past 10:30pm. (2) They did not expect the face of what any reasonable person would perceive as an unaccompanied minor to be the only one standing at the door. Proving this hypothesis out further, the husband even peeked over my right shoulder toward the parked cars to see if my parent or guardian was presently in tow. I regretted my decision to shoot first and ask questions later vis-a-vis booking this so-called non-chain-hotel the way people who think they want to commit suicide regret jumping from great and tragically unsurvivable heights, only to learn that their every problem had viable solutions except the problem they just caused: a terminally aproaching meeting with the earth's surface. Luckily the moment passed, and with this awkward exchange of bludgeoned expectations behind us, they cordially invited me in.

The interior had the countenance of an old Norse lodge, with an expansive open atrium surrounding a stone hearth, an open staircase to one side which led up to the guest rooms, at the base of which was a long table reclaimed from what appeared to be a dining hall for Vikings. The polished onyx-colored planks making up the top looked to be cut straight from an ancient war ship. The next morning I'd be eating sunny-side-up eggs over a square of lumber where the blood of ones enemies was spilled. Neat.




Let's put some beats down:

- feeling like I would never find the road
- the miracle of finding the wooded entrance in the dark
- the bewildered Bnb proprietor letting me in at 10 or 11 - whatever it was, it was later than they were expecing, it seemed
- Me only realizing at that moment that this wasn't a hotel. I wanted to rethink the whole thing, but in for a penny, in for a pound
- It was a lovely lodge, wasn't it
- Waking up and eating breakfast - how did I wake up on time?
- Meeting a few of the other drivers. One American, one French-canadian. Both super friendly. 
  - They were at different places in their lives - children, careers, something to lose. At the time I assumed this is what made them more tentative on the track
- Based on my lack of life experience, I had no business coordinating and executing and event like this. But that trait was ultimately responsible for exactly that. In the words of Dave Chappelle's friend Chip, I didn't know I couldn't do that. (obviously leave the chappelle part out)
- I was there on business, which was another difference between me and the dads with BMWs. I was there to test myself. Though doing so would be fun, I wasn't there to have fun, per se.


- Onto the event - does this need its own post, or can it be tacked on to the Bnb part? 
  - A group, B group. I was in B group because of my lack of experience. The timesheets had me at the top of B, middle of A. 
  

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
