Last week I was down for the count with COVID. My symptoms were very mild. A few aches the first couple days, and some sniffles the next few. There was, however, the bout of unexpected anxiety I suffered from being cooped up in the guest room all week. 

I spend much of my life convinced I am a lazy sonofabitch. Whether or not this is true is a matter of interpretation, but when faced with activity prohibition while in quarantine, I discovered something astonishing: I really like doing stuff.

When I initially realized I was in for a long holiday weekend of mandatory sitting-on-my-ass, a pang of excitment struck. No responsibilities, free time to read, watch movies, play video games, or even work on a side project. This was, let's say...short sighted.

I'm not big on going out to do things, per se. Or going to parties. Or traveling. But those are all examples of doing stuff socially. My bread and butter is solitude. If I'm working on something, fixing something, making something, or practicing something, I'm in my happy place. My mind is calm. Now, it has to be at least partially voluntary. If someone asks me to do something in which I truly have no interest, it's hard for me to get up for it. It also helps if it's mechanical or involves the building up, clearing out, or rearranging of something to make it better.

When I was a kid, I would always feung-shuei (holy shit, spelling) my room every few years to stay on top of the fight against those pesky lunar tides and keep my circadian rhythm aligned. JK, I was probably just bored.

Regardless, I have many projects to tend to around here, and the combination of my lack of energy from the illness and the GD quarantine meant I was a sweaty waste of space for days.

The whole experience crystalized something I've been thinking about for a few months: The concept of "At least I can do that."


<!-- NOTES: here's where the first draft diverges - I fixed up the above to set up a slightly different angle, starting with the final quote just above this line.
Next time: "One of the reasons I think I had such a hard time with quarantine is it took away the foundation I'd subconsciously been relying on for my self worth for (most of my life?). It's a neverending chase I've been on since I first got good at something. It's something I'm seeing in my youngest now as he enters middle school." NOW I can talk about the middle school transition BRIEFLY. Then talk about his distaste with his writing for that assignment (maybe?) and talk about how starting to introduce him to harder and harder (and more and more grown-up) skills is helping him build HIS foundation? -->




My youngest just started middle school which, in the American school system, is the biggest change in atmosphere that exists. From preschool to elementary school the kids are too young to know what's happening, and from middle school to high school, they're already pretty close to who they're going to be for the next half decade or more.

But elementary to middle is a lobster shell shedding[show link to the phenomenon] event.

Despite this shake-up, or maybe because of it, now is the greatest opportunity as a parent to make a similar change in approach, leaving behind the instincts to coddle and protect, and instead bolstering the message that I trust him to do more grown up things. 

Because every time I do something for him, I deny him all the anxiety-defeating ammunition I took for granted before I became a useless invalid with COVID. 

Notes for next time: This is starting to veer - I want to lead this into the idea that our anxiety lives in a small pool at the base of a hat rack. When we're young and useless, our hat rack has no hooks. So we have no choice but to place our hats - ourselves - right in the anxiety pool. But as we build skills and start accomplishing things for ourselves, we add hooks to the rack. Sometimes life comes along and puts its own hat on a hook, and we again have no place for ours. But as we...ok this is getting too far away. 

"At least I can do _that_" is the antidote to the state we find ourselves in as young (and sometimes not so young) adults. Who am I? Of what use am I? Giving my youngest (and ourselves) more responsibility builds him (and us) an arsenal of ammunition in the war against uselessness and self-doubt. "For all my faults, mistakes, and shortcomings, at least I can do that." 

Doing "that" and continuing to do it, and things like it, is the only reliable way to keep the demons of anxiety off me. 





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
