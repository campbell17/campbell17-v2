Stuck in the space between people who went further before they stopped and people who never started.

I thought I wanted to be a racing driver. I did want to be a racing driver. But I didn't want it _enough_.

How do I know this? I went to racing school. At the school there were instructors. These instructors also wanted to be professional racing drivers. And in a sense, they already were. They got paid some amount of money to teach other people the craft of racing. They made it further than me, but still hadn't "made it". One instructor made it as far one level below the top. Indy Lights.

At the school, the instructors would often take a group of students in a regular passenger car around the track and talk through the nuances of the line, the strategy, and the logistics of racing. In one such ride, it came up in coversation that the instructor had spent half a season last year in Indy Lights. I asked him, "why not a full season?" Still in my late teens, I was naive and thought maybe some extinuating circumstances torpedoed his campaign. I was shocked by the cold practical reality of his answer:

"Money."

As he hit the braking zone into turn 1, the conversation hushed. I wasn't sure if I made a faux pas by asking or if I'd accidentally given everyone the secret code to why they, and everyone they will ever know, will never make it all the way to the top. We were being driven around by the best of the 5 incredible instructors there that weekend, a man who spent thousands of hours on track including at the professional level, and even he couldn't conjure all the pieces together to reach the goal. Maybe for him, more money would have been the tipping point. Up the ladder he would have gone until one day I'd be watching him spraying champagne on the podium and I'd turn to my kids and say, "See that guy? He used to teach me how to race."

I didn't progress beyond "racing student". I didn't want it enough. The instructors wanted it bad enough to push their careers hard in that direction, such that they became teachers of the craft the loved and practiced. Some stopped there. Others went on to race sports cars in various series' not considered part of the upper echelon, and maybe that was just fine with them. 

I always grapple with the worthiness of my level. I didn't make it past the 3 racing school tiers I attended. Because "Money". But I did want it enough to obsess over the idea enough to at least try my hand and attend the school in the first place. I did well. It wasn't a complete mismatch of dream vs. ability. 

Next time: What am I saying? This: Racing is one thing in a long list of things I got higher than level 0 at but didn't go much further. How should I feel about this? Should I feel good that I publish a weekly essay even when I hate what I wrote? I'm in the arena, I guess. And I was in the arena when I was racing. It's pointless to compare, but can it give perspective? When I feel awful about what I'm doing, shouldn't the fact that I'm DOING be all I need to know to set my mind at ease?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
