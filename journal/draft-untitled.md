I saw a kid on a quad. We were driving back from the car dealership where I'd just plunked down the modicum of thousands we saved up to buy my newly-licensed daughter a car. But that milestone was immediately overshadowed the moment I saw this kid. No helmet. Going full chat on a dirty grass trail about 40 yards from the edge of the road. That's the most freedom I've ever witnessed first-hand. Just a kid on a quad. 

Notes? Who knows man. Keep going. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
