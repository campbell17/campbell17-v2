Look out the window. It's dark. It may be late. Or it may be early.

Across the street there are lights, but only two. 

They're far. But not too far. Maybe a quarter-mile. Maybe less.

<!-- But they're both lit. -->

The lights are in front of a door, but they don't illuminate it. It will be some time before the sun comes up, so the door's color remains forgotten for now.

The lights are perfectly level. Well spaced apart. But they're wrong.

They're a pair. Yet they don't match.

But they're both lit.

Mezmerizing are their differences. Calling for more than one glance. More than two glances. Now a full stare.

They were the same once. Still a pair. But a match. But one changed. Or the other changed. Or they both changed in divergent ways.

One is too warm. Or the other is too cool.

<!-- But they're both lit. -->

They were the same once. Both lit. But a match.

But one bulb died. One bulb replaced.

Now they don't match.

But they're both lit.

Look out the window. It's dark. And the lights are all that's out there.

But there's a door. For sure there's a door. But they don't illuminate it.

The lights work. But the door is dark.




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
