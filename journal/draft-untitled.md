Give Thanks for the PITA
Turning unavoidable toxicity into fuel.

Pain in the ass (PITA) people leave their mark on us. They complicate things, add stress to our lives, and throw wrenches into our flawless plans. Perhaps worst of all, and so obvious it borders on redundant, they have no idea how much of a pain in the ass they are. Unfortunately, despite curating as many irritants out of our lives as possible, sometimes the presence of PITAs is not optional. Maybe we were born into a family full of 'em. Or maybe our friend or romantic partner suddenly came down with a terminal case of pitarrhea and we're too inveseted in the relationship to just leave.

But there's hope. A silver lining. An opportunity. If we play our cards right, we can transform the toxicity of our PITAs into fuel for self improvement. It's like the scene from Back to the Future when Doc Brown digs through Marty's trash to nourish the DeLorean for the journey ahead. Except instead of beer cans and banana peels, we're using inexcusable narcisissm, and instead of a DeLorean, we're fueling upgrades to our emotional intelligence and social utility.

PITAs come in all shapes and sizes, but I want to focus on two specific types: the Stop Sign and the Scolder.

The Stop Sign is someone who spends most of their time stepping in various avoidable bear traps. They're prolific own-goal scorers. Expert foot-snipers. And they often suffer from foot-in-mouth disease, saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, thus further undermining their already unstable social standing. So far this sounds like a "them" problem, and it is. But the PITA enters the picture when the Stop Sign in question is someone we love and care intensely about. Their fatal flaws include a lack of humility, blindness to accountability, and an unwillingness to take criticism to heart. So no matter how many traps we illuminate in the darkness, they refuse to avoid getting snagged.

<!-- Notes for next time: Talk about how to use the Stop Sign's behavior to avoid simlar failures. Wrap that up, then move on to the Scolder. (The Scolder might be the opposite of the Stop Sign - instead of a complete lack of vision, they zero in perfectly. But instead of their focus being fixed on the road ahead, it's trained with a firm gaze on something else. You.) -->





- There are a number of types, but I'm heavily experienced in two, specifically: the Bad Example and the Critic.
- The Bad Example is someone close to us who spends most of their time stepping in various avoidable bear traps. They're the king of the own-goal. Foot snipers. And they have foot-in-mouth disease.
- The Critic is the over-honest purveyor and arbitor of how we conduct out business, pointing out flaws in our process, logic, execution, and reasoning.
- These people are a pain in the ass. Because you love them. Sometimes you wish you didn't, but wishing will never change that.
- But there's hope. Acute, sustained observation of the Bad Example, for example, produces a topographic map of many of life's wrong turns. In addition, the pain these people cause other people you care about give us the extra push we sometimes need to improve the way we act, making us better overall.
- If you have a Critic in your life, hopefully they're not family. You can't get rid of family as easily as you would a significant other or a friend, thought those are tough to break off as well. But in the meantime, while you're weathering the storm, approach this person's PITA-ness as an opportunity to learn more about some of your rough edges. In many cases, these could use some sanding and refinement, making you a better, more well-rounded person. This will come in handy for the next person you meet, as many of your most obvious flaws will have been brow-beaten out of you.
- This guy
- This, of course, only applies if you want to improve. If you think you're perfect, you're probably one of these bastards I'm talking about.

Notes: name why they have to be in our lives and what to do about it.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
