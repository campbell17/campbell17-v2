Wannabe.

- There are few things I appreciate more than someone who is so obviously and unapologetically themselves. 
- An earmark of these people is they have a hint of edge to them. Perhaps more explicitly put, they have defined edges, plural. As if I could reach out and touch their personality. Like it has dimension, and a tangible perimeter. 
- And because these people are human, and because humans are flawed, I'm magnetically drawn to ones who expose those boundariees rather than suppressing them. But this is a paradox, because the exposure of such boundaries must be unconscious for it to be genuine. And nothing spoils a personality quite like disingenuousness.
- 

It was a byproduct of her personality. Had to be. No one is that level-headed in the face of such annoyance.

- Back in college, I had a young but well-traveled professor. She was a photographer, a printmaker, a digital guru (rare at the time), and a mixed media wiz. 
- In art school, there are three types of students: 
- Student one: Already good enough to work and are either about to drop out or have enough outside help to get their degree to check that box.
- Student two: 
<!-- I got stuck there - trying to describe how annoying students are one of the staples of art school undergrads -->
- One student, while annoyingly telling a self-aggrandizing story, innocuously asked if this worldly professor had ever been to New York. 
- Keep in mind, this conversation took place about a 2 hour drive from New York, door to door.
- I was behind the student so I could see my professors face as she VERY politely listened to the story, and when that question popped up, she didn't react at all. She meekly said yes, and allowed this goddamned charade to continue. 
- But I don't mean "allowed" to apply fault to her response. I mean "allowed" to illustrate how deeply she could have buried this student for thinking she was more interesting than she was. She was in the presence of one of the most interesting people in the school, and clapped on obliviously anyway.

- I am not this graceful. Given the opportunity, I always try to find a way to make myself look good. 

Notes2: Got some direction. Original story will be a piece of the main, which is now focused on the edge honest people have without being assholish. Unapologetically THEM, which sometimes includes surprising (because it's becoming more and more rare) honesty, because things aren't so great (but things also aren't so bad, and there's merit in calling out the BS of people who complain when they shouldn't). Yeah, there's a mess here to clean up still. Next time, work on the point of not being an asshole just to be one, but having SOME of those qualities as a byproduct of telling the truth. Also, explore why people like Xcal and ProZD are compelling to me because of the way they lack sugar. It's the opposite of corporate speak, which always aims to lessen the blame or perception of fault, or perception of things not going well. Because how can you fix something you refuse to say is broken?

Notes: This needs a ton of work. What's the point? Where's the ending? Make people care.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
