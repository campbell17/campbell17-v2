What matters to me?

As I try to figure out what my creative life should look like moving forward, I always fall into the trap of looking online for ideas. I see the well-established and refined habits of professionals posting art, writing, ideas, and memes to an audience they built through prolific consistency. The people with th stickiest fans are usually the ones with the most obvious point of view, often one that's easy to encapsulate in a single sentence.

For someone like me, whose interests leap from whim to whim, this is daunting. My 20 year career as a designer began as a phone call from a friend simply looking for someone who could do the job well enough to get by. "I know this isn't your training, but since you know photoshop you could easily get this job."

This is hardly the stuff of purists. 

But the biggest obstacle between me and finding amy taylor-made niche is not the subject matter. It's my disposition. My whole life has but one common thread despite the throngs of interests, hobbies, and short-lived obsessions: ["Don't chase. Let it come to you."] note: I have to make this perfect. I don't think it's this, but it's close.

What does this mean? Well, more than anything it means I made a habit of adapting to whatever life chucked me. This may sound useful, but there's a hulking trade-off standing just out of view. The strategy of adaptation is one of least-resistance. Which means while there may be a hefty prize upstream, I'll never learn what it is because I'm too busy floating the other way with the current.

One of my favorite examples of this is when I played football. I only played two seasons, one when I was in 4th grade and another in 8th. In 4th grade I played defense only. For those who don't know, in youth football players usually play both offense and defense to get a sense of where they shine. But I didn't need to shine. I wanted to, and indeed when my friends and I played in the yard, I was a prolific nerf-ball quarterback. But we didn't have to memorize a play book in the yard. In organized football, there are plays, and I didn't feel like learning them, so I didn't. So the coaches, left with little choice, stuck me on all-time defense where I spent half the time wandering around hoping I didn't get yelled at, and the other half getting run over by the ball carrier. This was generously classified as "tackling". When I played in 8th grade, I was prepared to repeat the same process. The coaches asked me if I wanted to play offense and I said I only played defense before. So, seeing my indifference to the idea, they stuck me on all-time defense again. Only this time, my athleticism betrayed me.

During one practice around mid-season, I was covering a pass play deep down field. I pass got broken up and I hussled over to retrieve the ball. Seeing one of the other players back at the line of scrimmage with his hand up, I casually lazered a 45 yard strike into his outstretched hands. The coaches were...surprised.

The wisdom of an 8th graded who hasn't seen much of the world is quite limited. And with my lack of wisdom, I had always assumed _every_ boy could throw a football like I could. Half way back to the huddle, I realized something was happening. All three coaches had their eyes trained on me and the offense coordinator was all but chewing me out for not telling them I could throw at the beginning of the season. Here all this time they thought I didn't want to play offense because I wasn't any good at it, or that I was afraid of getting murdered by a giant linebacker (for the record, I was). What they didn't (and wouldn't) know is that I was simply more lazy than I was ambitious. I didn't want to take the time to learn the play book. But coaches be greedy.

They'd seen too much. I'd shown them too much. They were no longer in a position to squander a potential weapon. But the season was half over and we already had a quarterback who, now that I thought about it, didn't really throw the ball too much. Or ever. Oops. So in a flurry of improvisation, the coaches drew up a few new offensive plays that I could learn easily without having to know the entire offense. They stuck me at tight end so I could block most of the time, but every so often could be split out as a wide receiver and run a double pass - a play where the quarterback would throw me a lateral, making it legal for me to be the one to throw to a receiver down field. And just like that, we became the team with two quarterbacks.

The results were mixed, though on the whole I'd say the experiment was a success. But the catch is this: I, and by extension, _we_, could have been truly great. With a modicom of extra effort (or _any_ effort on my part), I could have learned the play book, been the first string quarterback, and actually utilized my athletic ability instead of being and feeling wholly unprepared on every play. The prize was a chance at something awesome, but I was just happy to participate, not striving to reach my potential.

Potential.

Early in college life, I became obsessed with my inability to reach my potential. Haunted by instances like those from my football days, I could never shake my nature of flowing wherever the water brought me. I went to art school not because I was obsessively creative, but because I liked drawing and that seemed like an interest I could turn into a career. I also had a decent eye for photography, but to me it seemed "too easy" a craft to pursue. This is another one of the irrational paradoxes facing me in my youth. I wanted a challenge but was ill-equipped to complete any. And in the end, I gave up illustration as my major because I couldn't bring myself to put in the work to reach my potential. So after deciding to change majors as an alternative to dropping out, I got my BFA degree in Photography.

My intrinsic need for clarity, stability, and homeostasis are traits one might associate with a driving curiosity. How could someone believe they would achieve those things without first learning everything there is to know about their subject so they feel amply prepared? This is a logical question. But the answer becomes clear once the digging starts. Curiosity almost always leads to more questions than answers. Every layer uncovered reveals multiple paths of further investigation required to garner expertise. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
