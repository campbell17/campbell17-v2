Ignorance isn't always bliss. Sometimes it's mandatory.

This is about a shed. 

We built it anyway. 

We think it will take a couple weeks. It takes a couple months. We build it anyway.

We think it will cost half. It costs double. We build it anyway.

We think it will be painless. We wake up sore every day. We build it anyway.

We make sure it's plumb. We check that it's level.

We fix some mistakes as we go. Others we leave for posterity. 

It's just a shed.

When the rain tries to stop us, we lay the tarps.

When the wind tries to move us, we tie it down.

Some tools we buy. Some tools we borrow.

We save all the scrap wood, because you never know.

<!-- Notes: arrange "We built it anyway" so it's not all in the same place? Find some rhyming endings?  -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
