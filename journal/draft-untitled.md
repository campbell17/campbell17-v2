Idea Cycles

My youngest son is 12. How will he look at the world in 10 years? I don't mean geopolitically. I mean his world. His immediate surroundings. How will he tackle new problems, the unexpected, and the unknown? He plays a lot of video games. I don't mind him liking video games. I played a lot of video games, too. But...

Video games are not the real world. They don't inspire action. At best, they provide an escape or, if you're as lucky and talented as a professional athlete, a career. But for 99.9% of us, they're nothing more than a time waster. Don't get me wrong, I'm a time waster from way back. (In a previous essay)[...] I catalogued the unending list of sports I waste my time on annually. But I've developed an internal timer that goes off when I'm being too wasteful for too long. The boy does not have that. Yet.

The problem with not having a timer like this, is there's no sense of what the cost is. Let's look at two scenarios:

In one, he plays video games at the same rate for the next ten years. The rate is "however much he can get away with". In the other, he limits himself to a set time per day and doesn't cheat. Let's be generous and give him two hours. For context, it's summer right now and in a heavy week with his friends on vacation and no day camps scheduled, he was hitting up to 10 hours per day. We'll come back to that later.

There's an 8 hour delta between his worst day and an average time-limited day. Let's add another constraint of this thought experiment and leave TV out of the equation. We can simplify everything and just call it all "screen time". 

If he's on a screen for the extra 8 hours, he isn't bored. If he isn't bored, he isn't thinking of anything to quell his boredom. If he isn't thinking, he isn't generating ideas. If he isn't generating ideas, he isn't getting curious. If he isn't getting curious, he isn't learning about the things he's curious about. If he isn't learning new things on his own, he isn't expanding himself naturally. He isn't learning how to learn. Think about the energy boost you get from learning something new when your own curiosity is the catalyst? Now consider the opposite - mandated learning by someone else. An assignment. No thanks, Teach.

If we look at the next ten years on his timeline, we can consider gaming as a flat line. No growth. One could argue that gaming teaches us new things, but those people have never hammered a nail in their life. To grow into and beyond our potential requires interacting with the physical world from time to time. 

In elementary school, I used to disassemble my clicky-top pens to see what was inside. I was curious to understand how they clicky-topped. When my classmates were looking for things to tease me about, this came in handy. Regardless, I was amazed to discover how simple the mechanism was once all the parts were out on my desk. Through a small amount of curiosity, I learned something new. "I guess I know all about pens now." I began to look around for other things to take apart. "I wonder what else I could figure out."

Asserting mastery over something as insignificant as a ballpoint pen made me feel handy. It made me feel _competent_. It gave me a break from constantly praying I wouldn't get called on in class, unable yet again to guess what the topic was about, let alone give the correct answer. I'd been bored so I stopped paying attention, and it was that very boredom prompting me to take notice of my pen in the first place. More on that later. <!-- (Idea: what if we scheduled a block of boring time? 2 hours - you can do anything you want, except read, watch TV, or play a game. The game one is tough - no board games or puzzles, either? I think so, because what we're after is exploration of creative thinking. DOing something to quell the boredom instead of merely passing the time mindlessly with a distraction.) -->

A few weeks ago, I had my son embark on a project. He was convicted of not lifting the toilet seat up to pee sometimes, leading to more than a few mishaps due to poor aim. We zeroed in on the culprit: the lid for this particular toilet seat overhangs the whole assembly slightly, making it difficult to lift both at the same time. It's not really difficult - I can do it just fine - but for a 12 year old already grossed out by touching _any_ part of the toilet, it's a non starter. What we need - what he needs - is a little handle of some kind, attached to the seat, that he can grab easily allowing him to lift both at once without giving it a second thought. We always trip over that second thought.

I brought him into the bathroom one morning and explained the details. 


<!-- Up next: we want to talk about the tape, so be brief with the setup, talk about how he felt before he started vs. how he felt once achieved the result. Talk about the trial and error. Then talk about the tape. He had little concept of what existed. It was a black hole. Now he knows all about tape. -->


<!-- Notes for next time - talk about the gains we make by being bored, the things we learn when we didn't even know they were part of the thing we were actually trying to do/learn. He had to attach a thing to another thing. Now he knows about tape. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
