Root Beer Injustice

- I don't know how it is for everyone else, but I think I won the memory lottery.
- When I look back on certain times in my life - say, ages 10-13, and I really try to _feel_ the feelings I experienced, I get intense nostalgia about even the things that went wrong.
- Maybe this is how nostalgia plays out for everyone. But even the acutely painful and embarrassing turds are polished to a mirror sheen and placed on a little stand in a climate-controlled acrylic case to join the other exhibits in my personal history museum.
- Case in point, when I was 12, I was hanging out with a friend. We rode our bikes to a convenience store. He bought a drink, and I bought one, too. Mine was a delicious root beer in a glass bottle. I didn't have that much money, but I had enough for this at least. When we left the store and got back on our bikes, I held my root beer against the handle bar so I could negotiate the hop off the sidewalk curb back onto the street. (OMG this is boring, obvs fix it). The impact of the bunny hop dislodged my precious root beer, causing the bottle to smash on the pavement and robbing me of my only joy in the world.
- I went back inside and grabbed another one, telling the clerk of my misfortune, half-hoping he would comp me the next one as a tough-luck-kid consolation prize. He did not.
- So I bought a second root beer.
- Now, one would think that an abundance of caution would be on the table for my next attempt at the convenience store egress. One would think that.
- But I held the bottle against the handlebar in a frighteningly similar fashion. However, THIS time I'll _walk_ the bike off the edge of the curb. I ain't nobody's fool. I proceed to gently (for a 12 year old) lower the front of the bike down from the sidewalk, and summarily drop the second bottle within an inch of the first bottle's wreckage. So close, in fact, that one would be forgiven for thinking only a single bottle was sacrificed to the convenience store parking lot gods that day.
- This...was not fair. When you're a kid you often feel like life isn't fair, but until this point I hadn't yet dunked on myself so hard that I shattered the glass. In this case, I shattered the backboard AND my tasty refreshments.
- My memory of what I did next is an unretrievable mixture of either going back in for a third drink or not having enough money and doing without. But the epilogue of the great root beer bottle caper isn't the chapter in question. It's the fact that despite all the raw and heartbreaking feelings I felt back in that moment, when I pull that withdraw that event from my memory bank, its essense registers as, "Man, how awesome was it riding bikes to the convenience store with my friends back then?" 
- This is clearly the perspective on an insane person.
- 

Notes for next time: Am I just lucky? Why remember anything about it at all if I'm just going to twist the reality? Is this a simple case of the effect of time smoothing the rough edges so we can continue to make progress instead of paralyzing ourselves with deep regret over past humiliations? I don't even remember what friend I was hanging out with that day. Possible ending: But what did I learn? If you step in a bear trap, maybe don't step in the same bear trap 5 minutes later? I guess that's a pretty useful lesson to learn. It's a shame it cost me two root beers. I bet those would have been tasty.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
