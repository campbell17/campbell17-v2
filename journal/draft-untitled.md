Nothing changes if nothing changes.

Yesterday I yelled at one of my kids for not doing what I asked him to do. He hates getting yelled at. So much so, he makes it a point to remind me every time he gets yelled at. When the dust settled, I had him sit next to me for an excrutiating (for him) conversation about what we might do differently next time to avoid the yelling. He admitted to understanding my instructions and recognized he had multiple chances to do what I asked before the yelling commenced. We pinpointed the precise moment my asking turned into yelling so he could recognize the threshold between the two. And he understood why there have to be consequences for his behavior. And yet...

I could not get him to commit to changing his behavior to prevent getting yelled at the next time this happened. And there will always be a next time. After all the digging to uncover the root cause, all the exposition about the rules of civilized human repart√©, and all the irrefutable logic laid before him, he still wanted to keep his options open. I have to commend his foresight. He knows agreeing to a set of boundaries now limits his ability to wriggle his way out of trouble on technical grounds in the future. And his carnal need for autonomy evidently trumps his disdain for my yelling. Time to look inward.

I put _him_ through the exercise of root cause analysis for our conflict, but I didn't fully explore my side of the equation. I must figure out what I can offer that is so disagreeable he would zestfully jettison his beloved autonomy to avoid it. Like all elegant solutions, it should have second and third-order benefits. For example, instead of yelling, I can calmly force him to clean his room every time he doesn't do what I ask. If he's smart, which he is, he'll eventually come to the realization that keeping his room clean at all times negates this punishment completely. He avoids traumatic yelling, we get a cleaner room in the house, and he minimizes the effects of the penance if his room is already clean to begin with. The only problem with an example like this is the diminishing returns on pain. He would undoubtedly return to the homeostasis of not listening as soon as the sting of discipline fell below the autonomy-need threshold. This doesn't mean it's not worth pursuing, however. Rather, I'll have to seek out other sophisticated alternatives to yelling that also achieve mutually profitable outcomes.

This all sounds good on paper, but there's an X factor I'm neglecting. It's what causes us to go shopping when we're broke, say yes when we mean no (and vice-versa), date people who are so obviously wrong for us. It's what separates us from the machines. I have a refrigerator magnet I've kept since college because it sums up this phenomenon perfectly:

"Warning: Due to a shortage of robots, the workers here have been replaced by human beings and may react unpredictably if abused."

We are not a rational species. And our unpredictability need not wait for abuse to come along before it manifests. This is acutely visible in all categories of self-defeating behavior. Once when I was a first-year high school student, I got a chance to sit at the cool kids table at lunch. I was not a particularly cool kid, but all the cliques and groups were still taking shape, so the lunch-room bylaws weren't written in stone yet and I had time before I got found out and sent back to eat with my fellow dorks. Anyway, the topic of getting out of schoolwork came up, and each cool kid was sharing their best strategy for turning the work in late without getting penalized. Classic dog-ate-my-homework stuff. Revealing myself as an obvious imposter, I naively asked something my parents frequently pointed out to me. "Isn't the effort required to get out of the work more work than doing the actual work?" The subsequent scoffing was both raucous and unanimous. I returned to my cohort of dorks the following week.

The mental rigidity of the cool kids echoes the self-sabotage we bring about when our pride is at stake. It's the same reason we dispute parking violations when we're clearly at fault. We're too proud to "let the system beat us".

Hey. 

Pay the $30, read the street signs next time, and move on with your life instead.

The human pattern of feeling externally victimized for our own behavior is cruel and pervasive. And it's easy to understand why. It's a mindfuck to realize you played a part in the orchestration of your own misery. Our default viewpoint, therefore, is to sidestep all culpability while wishing on a prayer that life isn't too mean to us. But nothing changes if nothing changes, and people who have a hard time accepting accountability for their circumstances tend to remain pinned under the irrationality of unjustified victimhood. It's a hallmark of narcissists, the world over. The rest of us, hopefully, will eventually come to a loose understanding that when the unexpected comes knocking, we may have been the one who inadvertently blazed its trail to our front door. But this realization only emerges by deliberately examining our decisions and behavior against the raging currents of our pride-preservation instincts.

For most, this is easier said than done, and for some it's all but impossible. But there's hope. Because over the years I've practiced a strategy that helps put me in the mindset of a problem solver instead of a victim. It doesn't necessarily _fix_ anything, but it rewires my brain to think more abstractly and go beyond the immediate emotion of the moment. Also, like cheap car insurance, this strategy is not meant for "acts of God". If you're walking home from work and a drunk driver jumps the curb and takes you out at the knees, it won't do much good to examine what you could have done differently. If you're the one in the car, however...enjoy prison, I guess.

Fine print aside, here's my strategy: When something happens that you consider bad or incongruous with your expectations, the first thing you need to do is ask yourself what you did to cause it, _regardless of whether or not you feel responsible for it_. You'll have to force yourself to do this as a practice, but that part gets easier over time. Allow yourself to feel the knee-jerk emotion of the situation for a moment, but only a moment. Then, step in and consciously run through all the decisions and behavior that led to this event. Finding an answer to "how did I cause this?" is required. You have to sit there and think back further and further into the timeline of cause and effect, and you can't stop until you find at least one thing you could have done differently that might have made the unexpected or undesired outcome slightly less so.
 
I've never failed to find something. Not even once. And practicing this brings into focus the part of the decision tree usually obscured by victimhood. Thus, I regain agency over my circumstances because no matter what happened, I clearly see where I can alter my behavior to make it happen less in the future. Failure to do this exposes me to a higher possibility of being unable to trace untenable situations back to their true root cause, which 100% of the time is something I did or didn't do properly.

Anyone who learns to do this earns the power to take the necessary steps to get out of whatever mess they get themselves into, as well as sharpening the skills needed to prevent future messes from manifesting themselves uninvited.

It's not easy, especially at first. At first it feels ludicrous. And most notably when things involve other people, who you obviously have no control over. But rare is the time we act out against another person without a reason, however petty. So try it out. Start simple. Find something that bugs you but isn't catastrophic, and see if you can do something about your behavior to set the decision tree on a different path. 

My son hates getting yelled at. In the moment, from his perspective, that's _happening to him_. But if he executed this strategy, he might feel more in control of whether or not it happens. He may choose to keep behaving in a way that illicits the yelling, but at least he'll feel more like he's the one at the controls of his life, so he can flip a switch and turn my yelling off at any time. In the moment, from my perspective, the fact that he isn't doing what I ask is _happening to me_. But likewise, if I executed this strategy, maybe I realize I haven't done enough to incentivize him to choose an alternative to yelling. So we can come up with a plan together to set some boundaries on which we both agree, thus fortifying some common ground.

In the end, despite it being such an introspective technique, the most powerful aspect of its implementation is perhaps its relationship-building applications. It's like a cheat code for personal conflict. Because the ability to recognize what's actually happening with our own behavior affords us the ability to _communicate_ that to others, which helps strip back the superficial layers and drill in to the core of the problem. And solving the actual problem is group activity, with both parties teaming up not against each other, but against the conflict itself. 



As a result, both participants in the relationship can grow closer and continue to solidify their foundation of trust and understanding. This doesn't always lead to agreement, 

<!-- Note: The following paragraph changes the tone and gets pretty accusatory. Is the above enough for an ending? If not, can we end it on a lighter note? This is not funny, is it? -->

<!-- ***** Note for Friday: Talk about the usefulness of this technique when it comes to relationships. "In the end, this skill becomes a cheat code for building relationships. Because the ability to recognize what's actually happening with our behavior dovetails with the ability to _communicate_ that to others, so both participants in the relationship can grow closer based on a solid foundation of trust..." -->

Victimhood as a consequence of catastrophe, violence, or other tragedy is something no one can predict or prevent. But victimhood as a lifestyle is completely avoidable. Unfortunately, it's never been easier or more acceptable to adopt as an ideology, but it's a trap. It's a trap because it incentivizes mental laziness and lack of effort, two of the most easily cultivable human traits, under the guise of a reprieve from accountability. With this mindset, no matter what you do you're not responsible for collateral damage because everything is simply happening _to you_ since you're not at the controls. This leads to more undesireable things which leads to more liability avoidance and the cycle never ends. 


<!-- note: need a transition between the above and the ending (or the below if it's to be the ending) -->

<!-- note: I feel like this should tie in more closely with the introduction. How does this relate to...nevermind - get back to chasing dragons of external factors. -->

Here's how to do it:

When something happens that you consider bad or incongruous with your expectations, the first thing you need to do is ask yourself what you did to cause it, _regardless of whether or not you feel responsible for it_. You'll have to force yourself to do this as a practice. Allow yourself to feel the knee-jerk emotion of the situation for a moment, but only a moment. Then, step in and consciously run through this thought exercise, a requirement of which is finding an answer. You have to sit there and think back further and further into the timeline of cause and effect, and you can't stop until you find at least one thing you could have done differently that might have made the unexpected or undesired outcome slightly less so.
 
I've never failed to find something. Not even once. Practicing this unlocks the agency of my circumstances because no matter what happens, I know I had a hand in it and can alter my behavior to make it happen less in the future. Failure to do this exposes me to a higher possibility of being unable to trace untenable situations back to their true root cause, which 100% of the time is something I did or didn't do properly.

Anyone who learns to do this earns the power to get out of whatever mess they get themselves into, and prevent future messes from manifesting themselves uninvited.




This is the most valuable skill I have. 


But that makes too much sense. That's too rational. And that would mean when we look around the table for the poor sap on which to blame this god-forsaken mess we call a life, all the chairs are empty. 

<!-- Notes for next time: self-defeating is the keyword. Explore that part of our irrationality and talk through some of the finer points of sabotage. -->

<!-- Notes for next time: The concept of cutting your nose off to spite your face. Tell the story about sitting at the cool kids lunch table and listening to them try to get out of doing an assignment. Then naively suggesting that the effort requred to get out of the work was more than the work itself. Something my parents taught me. That was hilariously wrong to them. But I knew it was right. Also, start exploring your sister's attitude toward changing the thing that needs to be changed, and how looking externally will always become chasing dragons sooner or later. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.
