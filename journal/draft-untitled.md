Smoke Bombs

As a kid – and sometimes as an adult if our life went sideways – there's a primal urge to be doing something we think we're not supposed to be doing. It's like the thrill of committing a miniature crime, only getting caught usually results in nothing more than a well-deserved grounding. If we _don't_ get caught, however, we ride that thrill like a tall wave out in the middle of the ocean that settles back down without ever crashing.

In 1992, I was living in Wexford, a suburb just north of Pittsburgh. We lived in a new development that had a symmetrical loop with a cul-de-sac on each side that looked like a diagram of the female reproductive system from above. On the south end of the loop there was a deep, craterous drainage area with a rock bed where the neighborhood culverts let out. When you climbed down into it, the hillside obscured the nearby houses, making it the perfect place for doing things you weren't supposed to be doing. This is where my friend Joey and I lit smoke bombs.

The smoke bombs resembled tiny versions of the explosives from a Tom & Jerry cartoon: a single sphere with a wick, except instead of black, these came in assorted colors and you got twelve per cellophane pack. I remember feeling disappointed at the time that they didn't sell something that actually exploded and we'd have to make do with lighting the fuses for colored smoke shows instead. In retrospect, it seems ridiculous that a 12 year old could buy these in the first place, but there I was, bummed out we couldn't get our hands on something even more dangerous. On the bright side, every mailbox in that neighborhood is still intact and I managed to retain all my digits.

They sold these all over but I remember getting mine at the same place I got the MAD Magazines I also wasn't supposed to have. My friend's mother didn't know that, and her level of strictness about these things was, to put it generously, astray. Just the mere act of putting the pack of smoke bombs and the magazine on the counter felt like I was getting away with murder in broad daylight. Are they really going to let me get these? The store was as tiny as an affordable Manhattan apartment and it sat alone at the corner of a desolate crossroad like it was from the old west. We made the left at this store to get to one of the travel baseball fields. The parents alternated carpooling duties so it must have been far away. When I was young I had zero ability to conceptualize distance or time in an automobile, so to me it was just as far as anything else. Anyway, despite our pleading, when my mom drove we rarely stopped at this store. Not that it would matter, since buying contraband like this was verboten on her watch.

Upon our return, we set off. Bye, Mom, we're going out to play.

- We go and light them. The act plays out like a brilliant bit. Setup, light the fuse. Build, the fuse burns down. Punchline, the chemical reaction forces the colored smoke to rush out.
- Eleven more to go. Joey and I took turns picking the next color and lighting the fuse. It was fabulous every time. The dozen smoke bombs provided all of twenty minutes of unadulterated entertainment. But now they were gone. We looked around. What else should we light on fire?
- Clearly nothing in this rock bed. Up the hill and across the street was a house under construction. Fast food wrappers. Paper cups. Scraps of lumber. A target-rich environment. We left the pile of delinquent evidence without even a thought of displacing it and after spraining many ankles on the rocky terrain, we emerged street-level.
- Houses in this neighborhood were built by elves. I was an outside cat, so I spent my youth sunburnt and sweaty. And every day I would go outside and see entire new wings of houses erected without ever seeing a soul or hearing a diesel engine idling. Not one. So with no foreman or supervisor in sight, I had to go inspect the elves' work myself. I spend a good year playing around new home construction sites. Climbing the giant piles of dirt and aggregate. Scaling the temporary-and-definitely-not-to-code stairs in the half-framed structures. Setting up the glass soda bottles on a sawhorse and breaking them with pitched rocks. And setting tiny fires with my mom's Bic cigarette lighters.
- What happened with Joey and me?

<!-- notes for next time: add the next section, maybe about getting them back to the house and then lighting them off, the feeling of getting away with something...where does that lead? Dunno, figure it out. Maybe also talk about how the store itself holds a stronger place in my memory than the smoke bombs. Why is that? Also, and this might, you know, be important - something has to happen for this story to qualify as a story. It can wander away from smoke bombs somewhat, but action must take place. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
