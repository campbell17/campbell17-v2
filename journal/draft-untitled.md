Remember that time in middle school I went to 7-11 with a friend before school started, bought non-alcoholic beer, and whipped it out during lunch to have with my PB&J?

- Sneaking away from the school premises in the first place
- Back then, students weren't hawked like they are now
- Oh btw, they sold it to us
- stashing it in our bags
- the big reveal
- our larger-than-life, yet friendly lunch aide simply confiscated them with an amused look - not chastising in any way
- oh btw, we didn't get in trouble
- I still had one in my backpack and drank some on the bus on the way home. 
- oh btw, it was gross
- There's something about the practice of acting older than your age. Try to describe that something.

Notes for next time: Would be good in a story form, similar to the rock throwing essay?


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
