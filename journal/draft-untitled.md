I punched my best friend in the face as hard as I could. In the nose, to be exact. He let out an ungodly yelp and rushed to the bathroom so he didn't get blood all over his bedroom. This was a highly unfortunate turn of events when you consider I was actually aiming for his older brother's ribcage.

There's a moment during childhood rough-housing when it goes from innocent fun to way over the line, and the gradient between those states is nil. It's like when you pet a dog a bit too hard for a bit too long and he snaps like a venus fly trap, though at least with the dog you might get a growl of warning. However, this haymaker, and my subsequent premature departure from my friend's house, represents the worst case of instant rage I ever experienced. I was 9 or 10, and nothing has come close since.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
