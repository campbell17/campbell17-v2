What does it mean to seek? We seek by looking with our eyes. We seek by asking someone a question. We seek by typing into a search box. We seek inside our minds when we think. When we want to know, we must seek to satisfy that want. When trying to create something new, we often seek out things others already made. Into the pit we go. We only get a small window to create each day. And as our window passes, we spend it admiring all the artifacts people were only able to create once they learned to avoid the pit.

But their voice isn't ours. We don't have a voice yet. Sometimes we have to borrow theirs to get started. We use our curiosity as leverage to reverse-engineer how they got to a place we admire. We imagine it was easy for them. It wasn't. We imagine it's in their genes. It isn't. We imagine they simply have natural talent. They don't. So what do they have? More to the point, what do they not have?

Whether through practice, temperament, or sheer pig-headed stubbornness, what they do not have is the ability, capacity, or tolerance to stop. 

<!-- I write once a week about ME (see below). Seth writes every day about IDEAS...more of that. -->

I don't know what anyone else thinks about themselves, but I'm certain I'm a selfish person. Am I any more selfish than the next slob? Maybe not. But I sense I'm not doing enough to warrant any ceremonies crowning me as Selfless Kinguuu. They have those, right?

So what is a man like me supposed to do about this? I could try harder. But I don't feel like doing that. There is one activity I practice, however, that might grant me some favor with the High Council of Charitable Humanitarian Self-Sacrifice – they're the ones that host the ceremonies – I look hard for stuff before I ask someone else to look for it.

This tiny act falls into a similar category as my "Did I Google It" https://www.campbell17.com/journal/the-google-it-rule rule, which mandates that before asking someone a coworker about something, Google it until your fingers bleed first. "Look harder" is the real life version of that principle.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
