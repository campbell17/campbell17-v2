- Last week I started to write about timing. 
- What came out was less about timing and more about recognizing and appreciating the moments when the timing was right and we chose an upward path.
- But I didn't feel like I could cross the topic off my list.
- I'm trying to avoid writing about how swell things are because there's a part of me that feels it's random.
- But for every stroke of good timing, i.e. luck, I remember, there have to be dozens of missed opportunities. Right?
*maybe have two overlaying graphs of jaggy upward trajectories that don't line up but are congruent in their upwardness?
- It's hard to imagine meeting someone better suited to be my wife than my wife. But the math doesn't bear this out. There has to be someone else out there - bizarro wife - that's just as compatible as she.
- Right?
- What I'm saying is there are three distinct moments responsible for the most meaningful crossroads in my life: Leaving Philly, meeting my wife, and answering the phone call that led to my current job.
- Nested amongst those are countless other events, decisions, and circumstances directly or indirectly responsible for shepharding me toward those three.
- The quandry is this: How much credit do I get to claim for this rat's nest of cause & effect?
- I suspect our mental model for this may be the most biased thing possible. Everyone having a swell time will likely claim a large chunk of responsibility for their success with people down on their luck claiming otherwise. 

*show a linear diagonal graph with Y axis "Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me." (0) to "Who do you think you are? I am." (100) (use the pictures from the quotes) and X axis "Life sucks and then you die" (0) to "Something funny that's good" (100)

- But this may be too simplistic. My sense is, consciencious people who are also highly successful feel comfortable admitting luck plays a huge part.

*show meme bell curve "It's all luck" | "I made this happen" | "It's all luck"

- Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

<!-- notes for next time: what do timing and luck have to do with each other? Don't make this all about luck, this is a timing essay. -->

- What does preparation look like? And how do we know when we're peering down the barrel of an opportunity?
- Let's start with preparation. Remember the question about how much credit I get to claim? That's a loser's question because it gazes back in time.
- Preparation is all about conditioning, as in, the conditions of my life set up in such a way that the default outcome is positive.
- This boils all the way down to my impulses. Impulse recognition and control is such an important skill, it should be the foundation of the health curriculum in education.
- My impulses are (insert funny word or similie). They binge-eat Oreos until their poo turns black. Then they doom-scroll Instagram reels while they're on the toilet until their right leg falls asleep. Why is it always the _right_ one?
- My impulses are unfit to arrange my conditions for me because they're incapable of looking beyond the moment. They never question their behavior and they never think ahead.
- Some might think there are philisophical implications of suppressing every impulse, as if doing so might somehow rob a person of spontaneity or personality. But those people, who I obviously just made up to prove a point, are mistaking impulses for _instincts_.
- So, impulses are in check. What's next? 
- We need a vision. It doesn't have to be crystal clear, planned out, or even accurate. But it can't be absent. If it's noble, that's even better, but nobility is less important than simply having one at all. We can zero in on aiming for something noble along the way.
- What kind of vision is this, exactly? Well, let's say I'm a kid in high school and I don't know what I want to be quite yet. What do I like to spend time on? What's the getting-paid-to-do-it version of that? Great. That's my tentative vision. I can course correct as my interests and competencies mature, but the earlier I start, the more practice I will have acting in the best interests of my vision.
- Once even a hint of a vision is established, the choices I make can be weighed against it, like a decision tree. "Does this choice help me take a step toward that vision, yes or no?" Maybe I don't know. Maybe it's unclear. Well, let's ask another way. "Does this choice have a strong chance of sending me in the opposite direction, hurting my chances of reaching that vision?" Sometimes that one is easier to answer. Now it's impulse control's time to shine. Because maybe that thing looks fun in the short term. And maybe my friends are all participating. But maybe I'm ignoring an important responsibility by going after it. And if the fun is _obviously_ bad for me, maybe I need some different friends who also have a noble vision.
- Which brings me to the company we keep. In [Getting into Trouble, for Crying Out Loud](https://campbellseventeen.substack.com/p/getting-into-trouble-for-crying-out), I referenced the conundrum of nature vs. nurture as it pertains to our gravitation to certain peer groups:

|...despite the obvious influence our peers have on our behavior, it's our natural attraction to those types of peers that really determines what path we end up taking in life. In other words, if I was born with a preternatural yearning to be perceived as "cool" and I grew up in an era where smoking was considered cool, my peer group wouldn't be the ones influencing me to smoke; rather, when I reached an age where that started to matter, I would naturally gravitate toward a peer group already consisting of smokers.

- When it comes to making progress toward our vision, our peers are instrumental in how we perceive success. The habits of the people with whom we spend the most time will inevitably rub off on us, and the industriousness of the group will follow a trajectory to match. In the example from above, those cool kid smokers, while an empirically unhealthy bunch, aren't necessarily "the wrong crowd". If they're shippers[1], they're gonna make it, and because of the unconscious forces driving us to keep up, so will we - we boost each other's successes. If, on the other hand, they do nothing but sit around, trash other people, and complain about the world, we have to get the fuck out of there. They'll do everything they can to drag us away from our vision because all our ambition shines a light on what they lack.

- So now we've controlled our impulses for more constructive decision-making, we set ourselves a vision, subject to change of course, and we cultivated a group of like-minded peers with a winning mindset to add support. 



Timing and luck are not mystical. And they're not random. They're agricultural. They're a byproduct of gardening. We cultivate the proper conditions to allow the good fortune in our lives to emerge and grow.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
