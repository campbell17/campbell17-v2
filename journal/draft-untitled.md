Self Imposed Tragedy

Making the wrong choice does not immediately constitute a tragedy. A tragedy only occurs the moment you _recognize_ you made the wrong choice. A tragedy, in this case, being an event that rocks you in some way. In some bad, regretful way. As opposed to the Freddie Mercury way. We should all be so lucky to be rocked that way. But I digress...

I witnessed my first tragedy when I was about six. I'd seen things I recognized as sad before then, like when my mom dropped and broke her favorite tea mug coming down the stairs a year earlier, but that wasn't a tragedy, as such. She didn't "choose" between letting the mug slip from her fingers and, you know, _not_ doing that. It was just an accident.

But when I was about six, while we were on vacation, I witnessed a bonafide tragedy. We went to a gloomy wharf, stood on a rickety dock, and prepared for a smelly morning of fishing. There was a man already there doing some fishing of his own and before too long, he caught one. I was gripped watching him pull an actual living creature out of the water. He lowered the fish to the dock and knelt down as if he was about to administer CPR. He then took out his pocket knife and placed it in front of his left knee. Now there were two things laying at the edge of the dock: a suffocating fish, and his knife. He arranged his patient to get a better angle to remove the hook, and as he pulled his hands away the fish lurched violently toward the water, bumping his knife in the process. Two objects once inert were now sliding toward the water, and our kneeling friend had a choice to make. The law of loss aversion states that any current thing is the most important thing in the galaxy, so the knife never stood a chance. As he placed both hands on the sliding fish, his knife gave him a wink, thanked the rest of us for coming, and performed a backward two-and-a-half-somersault pike off the dock and into the murky deep. It was breathtaking.

As the applause died down, I looked at the man and saw in his face the recognition of the consequence of his choice. That solitary moment of awareness is where tragedy lives. The depth of the tragedy would only be determined by his demeanor in the 5 seconds after this moment. It's conceivable this moment isn't a tragedy at all. That the knife was just some cheapie he bought at the dollar store on the way to the wharf because he forgot his good knife at home. But it's also possible this knife was a gift from his grandfather, who despite encouraging the man to use it often and not be too precious about it, imbued it with a deep sentimental value that recently intensified when he passed away. This would make the knife irreplaceable and the tragedy all but catastrophic.

As far as I could tell, the man's reaction was closer to the former. Annoyed but amused, he proclaimed, "I grabbed the wrong one!" Tears shed over the knife: zero. I guess he keeps grandpa's knife on the shelf in front of the photo of him from the war.

If we're lucky, most of us will only encounter tragedies we're equipped to handle. NOTE: where I'm going with this is: sometimes we encounter something so antithetical to our way of thinking, we turn off our curiosity and ____ (prevent from growing) out mental state. This lack of mental liquidity closes doors and blocks off potential growth pathways. (reference coleman's post). To avoid this, we must keep our minds loose. We must encourage ourselves to stay liquid. We must seek out our tragedies.

In The Art of Racing in the Rain, there's a passage about intentionally inducing a slide on a wet track, thereby reversing your role from hapless bystander to commander of his own fate. The track is wet. The car is _going to_ slide. But if I volunteer to slide instead of waiting around for it to happen _to me_, I get to pick when and how:

| "Rain amplifies your mistakes, and water on the track can make your car handle unpredictably. When something unpredictable happens you have to react to it; if you’re reacting at speed, you’re reacting too late...If I intentionally make the car do something, then I can
predict what it’s going to do. In other words, it’s only unpredictable if I’m not…possessing… it.”

Bearing a great burden voluntarily will always win against hiding from it. Because great burdens are not optional. And when you hide from them in the bushes, not only will they find you and require your attention the most inopportune time, but they'll use their machetes to do it.

Notes for next time: Finish the paragraph about mental liquidity



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
