There's a problem with creative coaching, and I'm trying to put my finger on it.

I dunno, maybe it's just me. But every time I peek around my corner of the internet, someone is selling me sales training masqueraded as "creative growth" or "audience building". I'm a hopeless romantic when it comes to creative merit. I desperately want to believe that projects gain popularity and achieve success based mostly on their objective quality. Unfortunately, that's not how the world works. It reminds me of the nature vs. nurture debate. As a parent, I romatically hold out hope that I have a fighting chance of shaping my children into well-adjusted societal members. As a pragmatist, however, I have a nagging suspicion most people have a strict nature from birth. So just as there's a ceiling on how much impact my "sage wisdom" has on who my children become, there's a ceiling on the implicit value of creative work and its subsequent success. The rest has to come from _telling_ people how valuable something supposedly is. So how does this relate to the proliferation of creative coaching?

To answer that, first let's travel back in time. The year was 2009, and I was struggling to get a freelance design career off the ground. I had a few clients and some successful projects under my belt, but it became clear (a little too late) it wouldn't be enough to live on. I needed a steady job, and I needed it fast. I ended up getting hired at what I thought was web design agency, but I was so desperate in my job search I didn't pay close attention to the red flag on their website: for all the talk about how great the company culture was - free lunch Fridays, flag football & softball leagues, unlimited snacks, and so on - there was no mention of any projects they worked on. No portfolio, no client list, no nothing. What did they actually _do_ here? (gif of the Bobs)

Nothing ethical, as it turned out, and as soon as another offer came my way I was gone. But that experience upgraded my BS radar, and now my antennae perk up whenever I encounted a supposed expert creative coach. Someone who will teach me how to make money online by creating and selling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and sellling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and selling...sorry, will you excuse me for just a second? *GIF of Edward Norton punching himself in the face for the first time

And there's the problem. These people don't _do_ anything. And not only do these people not do anything, their entire business model is predicated on teaching you how to sell not doing anything. "Here's an online course on how to build an online course." For what, though? It's no more than a multi-level marketing grift.

Now, I don't want to give off the impression that I think all creative coaching/instruction is a scam. Quite the opposite. Anyone in a creative field with the drive to improve and the curiosity to grow has a global knowledge base at their fingertips, as well as highly qualified professionals willing to teach them for a fraction of the cost of a traditional university. But therein lies the nuance that isn't always easy to spot. These highly qualified professionals are _producing work_. Their creative output is something tangible and the coaching they provide is a byproduct of the skill and experience they've built up sparring in the creative arena all these years.

Ok great. Some people make things and other people pretend. Who cares? People have been scamming since lying was invented. "Hey, did you happen take a bite from this apple?" "Umm, no." SCAMMED. (2 panel meme with adam and eve scene, SCAMMED over the god figure in the second panel. Seems verbose for a throwaway, but whatevs). I care. Because I loathe do-nothings. A do-nothing is the person that talks the most in the meeting, but can't actually do anything to put the plan into action. And these frauds form a cesspool of do-nothings. It's all smoke and mirrors for what boils down to sales training, but they don't call it that. And maybe that's why it bothers me so much. It's the disingenuous nature of it that gets under my skin. Though, I must commend the brilliance of the business model, because the outcome is completely disconnected from the service. What is the outcome? The outcome they're selling is me becoming an entreprenuer with my own product(s). What products, you ask? Doesn't matter. At least not to them.

This is not to be confused with people who unapologetically do nothing and also keep their mouth shut about it. Those people I envy.

And given an innocuous upbringing - no undeserved trauma or health problems, for example - they will grow into the same people by age 40 no matter what nurturing takes place. Granted, at the extremes, our environment has a tremendous impact on who we become, but at the meat of the bell curve, it all comes out in the wash. 


- There's a problem with online coaching, and I'm trying to put my finger on it. 
- I used to work for a company that was scammy. I thought they were a web design agency since that's what their website said, but I didn't look closely enough. I was young and early in my career and just needed something to take the place of my failing freelance business. The website talked a lot about the company culture, but the red flag - which I clearly ignored - was no mention of any projects they worked on. No portfolio. What did they actually _do_ at this place? 
- I feel the same way whenever I encounter a supposed expert online coach. Someone who will teach me how to make money online by creating and selling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and sellling products that tell people how to make money online by creating and selling...sorry, will you excuse me for just a second? *GIF of Edward Norton punching himself in the face for the first time
- Can anyone spot the problem here? Not only to these people not really do anything, their entire business model is predicated on teaching you how to not really do anything either. Here's an online course on how to build an online course." For what, though? It's like an infitie Russian doll. 
- I don't want to give off the impression that I think online coaching/instruction is a scam. Quite the opposite. Anyone in a creative field with the drive to improve and the curiosity to grow has a global knowledge base at their fingertips for a fraction of the cost of a traditional university. "So is all online coaching a scam? No."
- Who cares? People have been scamming since lying was invented. "Hey, did you happen take a bite from this apple?" "Umm, no." SCAMMED. (2 panel meme with adam and eve scene, SCAMMED over the god figure in the second panel. Seems verbose for a throwaway, but whatevs). I care. Because I loathe do-nothings. A do-nothing is the person that talks the most in the meeting, but can't actually do anything to put the plan into action. This is not to be confused with people who unapologetically do nothing and also keep their mouth shut about it. Those people I envy.
- But online coaching is a cesspool of do-nothings. These door-to-door vacuum salesman don't even sell vacuums. They create them.
- It's all smoke and mirrors for what boils down to sales training. Maybe that's why it bothers me so much. The business model is brilliant, because the outcome is completely disconnected from the service. What is the outcome? The outcome these people sell is I become an entreprenuer with my own product(s). What products, you ask? Doesn't matter. At least not to them. 

- Everything always returns to mileage. If I'm not putting in the mileage now, what makes me think paying someone to tell me I'm not putting in the mileage is going to change my habits. I need to take agency of my own life and do it myself first. Once my habits are bulletproof, THEN I employ a real coach to get me from good to great or great to elite. Only I can take me from nothing to good, and that only starts with my routines.

The possible end: We buy things to make our lives easier. We buy convenience. We buy creature comforts. We buy shortcuts. The value we get for the money we pay should be immediate and obvious. But when it comes to online coaching, unless I'm paying for a class that directly affects a skill I'm trying to build - immediately and obviously - I'm buying an empty cereal box. They don't come right out and say it, but what those people are actually selling me is the potential to sell my own empty cereal box to _(the greater fool)[link to the theory]_. So I don't give them my money. I take that money and buy my mother flowers instead as a thank-you for raising me better than that. Momma didn't raise no fools. 

If I sign up for a seminar or workshop, or 1:1 call, (etc etc), once the service is rendered, nothing happens. I paid money to learn something. Ok, that sounds valuable. But these services are marketed as clear stepping stones 

Gonna redeploy this from personal Mac to fix build error...

Notes for next time: Explore why do-nothings suck so hard? This could be a direction to go.

I need to distinguish the cosmetic, surface level observations here from something more compelling. Dig deeper into why this is a problem and how it's even all that different from any other scam out there. 

Also, separate the do-nothings from the real McCoys, Draplins et al, who provide practical training. Training is different than productizing coaching. Being coached to be a coach is vapid unless you've already put in the mileage and are hoping to teach others what you know.

Also, differentiate between online coaching that's 1 level deep - therapy, organization, parenting, etc. These are teaching you practical techniques and skills to address specific problems, pains, and issues in your life. The level is 1, from coach to player. My problem is with coaching to coach. Unless you're Peyton Manning giving a seminar on how to be an actual football coach, which as you can see is the 1 level deep type, you're doing it wrong.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
