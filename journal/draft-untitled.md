Choosing the target

"Oh. I actually did it."

I don't know why I was surprised. By the age of twelve, I'd thrown so many objects I should have been able to knock a hummingbird out of the air with a pebble from twenty yards. Not that I'd want to. Yet, while winging a rock at the house across the street, I was astonished I'd actually shattered the window. You know, the window on the bottom left. The exact window I was aiming for.

As I recall this moment, a few things immediately come to mind in a desperate attempt to dull the spears of incredulity and exonerate myself from judgement. First, the house was still being built, so it was an unoccupied structure sitting on a lot of dirt, rocks, and construction supplies. Second, the window-seeking rock was the only one I threw, meaning I wasn't just standing there throwing rock after rock, hell-bent on breaking windows. Finally, and this may or may not be revisionist history, but if I remember correctly I was just seeing if I could reach the house. Yes, I aimed towards the window, but the house was so far away I didn't expect the rock to get there.

Regardless, though, I achieved my goal. Yay. My reward was writing "I will not throw rocks at houses any more" 100 times. 

Notes for next time: 
- Why was that my target? 
- I surprised myself by achieving my goal, but now what? 
- Oops, my goal was wrong. 
- The things we aim at are more important that whether or not we hit them. 
- There's a saying in golf, never punish yourself for a good shot. If I'm slicing the ball to the right all day, I might decide to aim into the left woods to account for that. But there's a chance I'll hit it straight - a "good shot" - and end up losing my ball. So instead of aiming into the woods, I aim just at the edge, so a good shot will end up safe instead of lost (holy fuck dude, BORING. Use it but make it suck less). 
- Also, maybe be less of a chicken shit with the second paragraph. Do people want to read you making excuses? Probably not. At the very least make it funnier.
- Maybe make the sentence writing punishment the ending?
- Maybe add some concrete examples of aiming going wrong vs. right?
- What happens when you don't aim at all?
- 



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
