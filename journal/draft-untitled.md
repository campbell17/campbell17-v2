Let them do it.

The good mother necessarily fails. 

- We have an instinct compelling us to fix all we can with whatever we see with whatever we have at our disposal. 
- This includes fixing ourselves, and by extension, our problems. But this also includes fixing the people around us, and by extension their problems.
- Nothing is more emblematic of this than being a parent. Which makes sense, because for the first several years of their lives, our children would _literally die_ without our undivided dedication to the pursuit of preventing it.
- But this need doesn't last forever. In fact, it doesn't even last all that long, all things considered. As soon as a child becomes sentient, presumably, they could be taught the skills needed to feed themselves if no one were around to do it for them. If I wanted to be more precise, I could Google something like "average age for a child to choose feeding itself over starving to death", but I don't want any uniformed strangers ringing my doorbell.
- Regardless, the instinct to provide is so strong, ______ eventually becomes enablement, robbing the child of a chance to develop the skills necessary to survive and thrive in the adult world.
- This is evident in certain adults we meet, who seem somehow dysfunctional when compared to a reasonable expectation of how the average, well-adjusted adult should act. 
- In many cases this doesn't concern us since we can choose to leave the weird strangers to their own devices.
- But in the case of friends, loved ones, friends of friends, coworkers, and un-ingnorable acquaintences, the risk of dipping into our fix-the-problem instincts is high. 
- This is where the "necessary failure" plays its part. - Note for continuing: Of course we want to help. Of course we want to be supportive. Of course we want to show generosity, guidance, and kindness. And we do. But a time comes when kindness transforms into enablement. No human voluntarily chooses the resistant path. When we blaze someone else's trail for them, they can't see the skills they missed out on building. They simply walk forward.
- When kids are young, we have no choice. We must guide them. But as they grow we have to start judging if, when, and how we begin to step aside. Anecdotally, the more kids we have, the easier it is to soften our attention on every detail. If we have 5 kids, for example, we have 5 different paths to juggle, making it far more likely we "fail" to prevent them from tripping themselves up in the their natural course of growth and learning. These stumbles are critically important in their ability to develop the skills necessary to solve their own problems. If, on the other hand, we have 1 or 2 children, or if the age gaps are wide, it's much more difficult to let them stumble because we hawk each one like the eye of Sauron. So our "failures" need a more proactive approach, requiring conscious effort to combat our early-motherly instincts. 

Notes for next time: That's for kids. How is it different for our peers, friends, siblings, etc? Well...

But there comes a point where no amount of these things will impart the change needed to keep someone on an upward path. So we set up the boundary. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
