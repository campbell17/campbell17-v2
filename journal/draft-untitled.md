Idea Cycles

My youngest son is 12. How will he look at the world in 10 years? I don't mean geopolitically. I mean his world. His immediate surroundings. How will he tackle new problems, the unexpected, and the unknown? He plays a lot of video games. I don't mind him liking video games. I played a lot of video games, too. But...

Video games are not the real world. They don't inspire action. At best, they provide an escape or, if you're as lucky and talented as a professional athlete, a career. But for 99.9% of us, they're nothing more than a time waster. Don't get me wrong, I'm a time waster from way back. (In a previous essay)[...] I catalogued the unending list of sports I waste my time on annually. But I've developed an internal timer that goes off when I'm being too wasteful for too long. The boy does not have that. Yet.

The problem with not having a timer like this, is there's no sense of what its costing his future. Let's look at two scenarios:

In one, he plays video games at the same rate for the next ten years. The rate is "however much he can get away with". In the other, he limits himself to a set time per day and doesn't cheat. Let's be generous and give him two hours. For context, it's summer right now and in a heavy week with his friends on vacation and no day camps scheduled, he was hitting up to 10 hours per day. We'll come back to that later.

There's an 8 hour delta between his worst day and an average time-limited day. Let's add another constraint of this thought experiment and leave TV out of the equation. We can simplify everything and just call it all "screen time". 

If he's on a screen for the extra 8 hours, he isn't bored. If he isn't bored, he isn't thinking of anything to quell his boredom. If he isn't thinking, he isn't generating ideas. If he isn't generating ideas, he isn't getting curious. If he isn't getting curious, he isn't learning about the things he's curious about. If he isn't learning new things on his own, he isn't expanding himself naturally. He isn't learning how to learn. How much energy do you have to learn about something when it's your idea? Now think about how much energy you have to learn something someone else mandated for you?

If we look at the next ten years on a timeline, we can consider gaming as a straight line. There's no growth. One could argue that gaming teaches us new things, but those people have never hammered a nail in their life. The difference between beating a boss in a video game world (fantasy) and successfully completing a project as simple as hanging a framed picture in our room (real) couldn't be further apart for our mental health. (<- fix this sentence - clunky)

<!-- Notes for next time - talk about the gains we make by being bored, the things we learn when we didn't even know they were part of the thing we were actually trying to do/learn. He had to attach a thing to another thing. Now he knows about tape. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
