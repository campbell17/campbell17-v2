- Last week I started to write about timing. 
- What came out was less about timing and more about recognizing and appreciating the moments when the timing was right and we chose an upward path.
- But I didn't feel like I could cross the topic off my list.
- I'm trying to avoid writing about how swell things are because there's a part of me that feels it's random.
- But for every stroke of good timing, i.e. luck, I remember, there have to be dozens of missed opportunities. Right?
*maybe have two overlaying graphs of jaggy upward trajectories that don't line up but are congruent in their upwardness?
- It's hard to imagine meeting someone better suited to be my wife than my wife. But the math doesn't bear this out. There has to be someone else out there - bizarro wife - that's just as compatible as she.
- Right?
- What I'm saying is there are three distinct moments responsible for the most meaningful crossroads in my life: Leaving Philly, meeting my wife, and answering the phone call that led to my current job.
- Nested amongst those are countless other events, decisions, and circumstances directly or indirectly responsible for shepharding me toward those three.
- The quandry is this: How much credit do I get to claim for this rat's nest of cause end effect?
- I suspect our mental model for this may be the most biased thing possible. Everyone having a swell time will likely claim a large chunk of responsibility for their success with people down on their luck claiming otherwise. 
*show a linear diagonal graph with Y axis "Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me." (0) to "Who do you think you are? I am." (100) (use the pictures from the quotes) and X axis "Life sucks and then you die" (0) to "Something funny that's good" (100)
- But this may be too simplistic. My sense is, consciencious people who are also highly successful feel comfortable admitting luck plays a huge part.
* show meme bell curve "It's all luck" | "I made this happen" | "It's all luck"
- Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

<!-- notes for next time: what do timing and luck have to do with each other? Don't make this all about luck, this is a timing essay. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
