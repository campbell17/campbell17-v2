Smoke Bombs

There's a primal urge to be doing something we think we're not supposed to be doing. The thrill of committing a miniature crime. If we get caught, nothing too damaging happens, but if we don't get caught, we ride the thrill like a tidal wave in the middle of the ocean that slowly comes back down to the surface without another soul ever seeing it. 

In 1992, I was living in Wexford, a suburb just north of Pittsburgh. We lived in a new development that had a symmetrical loop with a cul-de-sac on each side that looked like a diagram of the female reproductive system from above. On the south end of the loop there was a deep, craterous drainage area with a rock bed where the neighborhood culverts let out. When you climbed down into it, the hillside obscured the nearby houses, making it the perfect place for doing things you weren't supposed to be doing. This is where my friends and I would light smoke bombs.

The smoke bombs resembled tiny versions of the explosives from a Tom & Jerry cartoon: a single sphere with a wick, except instead of black, these came in assorted colors and you got twelve per cellophane pack. I remember feeling disappointed at the time that they didn't sell something that actually exploded and we'd have to make do with lighting the fuses for colored smoke shows instead. In retrospect, it seems ridiculous that a 12 year old could buy these in the first place, but there I was, bummed out we couldn't get our hands on something even more dangerous.

They sold these all over but I only remember getting mine at the same place I got the MAD Magazines I also wasn't supposed to have. My friend's mother didn't know that, and her level of strictness about these things was, to put it kindly, lax. Just the mere act of putting the bombs and the magazine on the counter felt like I was getting away with murder in broad daylight. "Are they really going to let me get these?", I kept thinking to myself, waiting for my friend's mother or the clerk to see right through my casual demeanor and into my chest where my racing heart was convinced we'd get found out. The store was like a relic, sitting at a desolate crossroads as if we were in the old west. We made the left at this road to get to certain travel baseball games and the parents alternated carpooling. Despite our pleading, my mom rarely stopped at this store. Not that it would matter, since I couldn't get the goods with her around.

notes for next time: add the next section, maybe about getting them back to the house and then lighting them off, the feeling of getting away with something...where does that lead? Dunno, figure it out.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
