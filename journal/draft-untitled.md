"Are you scared?"

"Of what?"

"I don't know, don't you ever get scared back here?"

"Of what?"

"Well, look around. It's all...isolated around here."

"What do you mean? We're on a dirt road. Obviously _some_ people come back here."

"Exactly. Aren't you afraid you'll be kidnapped or something?"

"Not really. Maybe that'd spice things up, at least."

The two friends fell silent for a moment as they continued single file through the trail behind the houses.

"Shh! I think I heard something!"

The boy looks back for a moment to catch the girl in a mischevious grin.

"How far is it?" the girl asked.

"Five or ten minutes. There or thereabouts."

"'Thereabouts'?"

"Yeah, you've never heard that?"

"I have not," she says with one eyebrow raised. "Anyway, how often do you go this way?"

"All the time," the boy says over his shoulder. "I can't take my bike, but it's so much shorter it doesn't matter. Besides, once we get there everything is so bunched up you don't need a bike."

The trail ran through a valley bisecting two stretches of woods. A quarter-mile to the west, the woods opened into the edge of the boy's neighborhood. Equidistant to the east and up the big hill is their destination - the spirited paragon of suburban existence: The Wexford strip mall.

The girl looked across the clearing toward the hill.

"How did you find this way?" she asked.

"Curiosity, I guess," replied the boy. "I saw a little gap in the woods and wanted to see where it went. When I got down here I figured I'd gotten this far, I might as well keep going."

"Boys are so weird."

"Boys...what boys? You hanging out with other boys?" he teased.

"No, boys in general, you dork."

"Mmmhmm, a likely story."

The girl suppressed a smile and rolled her eyes. Then she noticed the familiar sensation of a loose shoelace.

"Can we stop for a second? I need to tie my shoe."

"Yup," he said, turning around just in time to note the way her ponytail bounced as she crouched.

The boy observed as she tended to the Chuck Taylor on her left foot. He wondered if she would be a bunny ears or a loop-and-swoop girl. She rose with a fresh smile and they continued hiking south.

"How much further is it?" the girl asked.

"See those power lines?" he pointed ahead. "That's about the halfway point. They cut through the woods on the other side, so we can follow them up to the main road."

"Cool."

Something something setting summer something or other.

"Nnnext," she blurted out.

"What?"

"Yes...you're next," she sang. "You're so nnnext."

"Is that...Bugs Bunny?" he asked, unable to mask his joy.

"Isn't Bugs Bunny the best?" she returned.

"Man, I used to watch Looney Tunes _constantly_ when I was a kid. I've never met a girl who could quote Bugs Bunny."

"Well, now you have, sir."

"You're even cooler than I thought."

"Flattered," she conceded. "So, where are we going first when we get there?"

"I was thinking" --> leaving off here. Next time: Map out their plans and keep going.



Notes for next time: Just keep going, I guess. See what develops. I have a memory for this but it's so vague I can essentially make it up as I go. The only other thing I remember is whoever this kid was trying to jump-scare me (playfully, not annoyingly).

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
