Doing Something For the Second Time.

You'd think after 40+ years of doing stuff for the first time, the list of stuff would begin to shrink. But nearly every week, I come out of a ____ and discover I'm elbows-deep in some new task I've never had a reason to complete before. 

Yesterday I replaced the rim on an outdoor basketball hoop. Last week I used a woodworking router for the first time. I needed the router to finish off the first piece of furniture I ever made. It was an oversized shoe bench for our entryway. A few days before that, I was up to my shoulders in fender metal, in my first ever attempt to replace the passenger-side inner tie rod on my wife's 2012 Mazda that recently developed a knocking sound in the suspension.

I already have a few firsts picked out for next year. Build a shed. Purchase a portable generator. Rent a hydraulic log splitter. 

<!-- Notes for next time: Describe the difference in mindset between doing something for the first and second times -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
