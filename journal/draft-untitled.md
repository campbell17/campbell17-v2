- Watching the kids play wall-ball or as we used to call it, "buns up"
- I catch myself wishing my kid did the same things I did, wishing he had fun the way I did
- Everything has a price - is this the price of growing up idyllically? Having it too good, so I want my kids to walk in my footsteps?
- My relationship with baseball soured when I got cut in highschool. At the time I thought it unjust, but as an adult I understand.
- The love for the game got rekindled when he started playing, and it kills me that he gets to have fun and my time is over.
- I help out at practice sometimes and it's fun, but it probably looks sad from the outside, like someone trying to rekindle something
- When does he get to play how he wants? When does encouragement turn into manipulation to fulfill vicariousness?

Notes for next time: this is gonna be weird. Try to find the ending and/or surprise first before moving on with the outline.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
