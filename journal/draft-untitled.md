"Are you scared?"

"Of what?"

"I don't know, don't you ever get scared back here?"

"Of what?"

"Well, look around. It's all...isolated around here."

"What do you mean? We're on a dirt road. Obviously _some_ people come back here."

"Exactly. Aren't you afraid you'll be kidnapped or something?"

"Not really. Maybe that'd spice things up, at least."

The two boys fell silent for a moment as they continued through the trail behind the houses.

"How far is it?" asked boy1.

"Five or ten minutes. There or thereabouts."

" 'Thereabouts'?"

"Yeah, you've never heard that?"

"I have not. Anyway, how often do you go this way?"

"All the time. I can't take my bike, but it's so much shorter it doesn't matter. Besides, once we get there everything is so bunched up you don't need a bike."

Notes for next time: Just keep going, I guess. See what develops. I have a memory for this but it's so vague I can essentially make it up as I go. The only other thing I remember is whoever this kid was trying to jump-scare me (playfully, not annoyingly).

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
