- I scare my youngest son with my driving. 
- He's a nervous type, so I'm not sure I'm fully to blame.
- But it seems we Campbell's enjoy a healthy tradition of vehicular anxiety.
- When me and my dad used to drive through traffic going into the city, it sometimes got a little sketchy.
- I didn't want to make him aware of my fear, so I devised a strategy: close my eyes.
- Despite being young, I understood my eyes were to blame for my fear and if I was in the same seat going the same speed with no cars around us, I would feel fine.
- So that's where I went. I closed my eyes and visualized an empty highway. I let myself believe there were no cars nearby and turned the bumps in the road into my personal massage chair.
- This worked. But not without its tradeoffs.
- "Open your eyes!", she shouted. She was incredulous. My best friend's mom must have peeked over at me as we came around the final corner. She couldn't understand why I would get on the steepest, fastest roller coaster in the world and spend the entire time with my eyes closed pretending to be somewhere else. I just wanted to say I did it. But if I didn't feel anything, did I?
- Burying my head in the sand has its utility, but the mentality behind it matters. Using it as a means to avoid heightened panic is worth doing, but using it as a crutch to avoid experiencing life is where things get dicey.
- If it becomes a habit, the act of avoiding problems spills into things like personal responsibility, where mandatory attention is required. Pretty soon I happy-place myself into complete and utter unreliability. Regaining the trust and faith of others after earning that label is tough sledding.
- What's worse, I get so skilled at meditating my worries away, even small tasks are more easily avoided, leading to supercharged procrastination. And if a phone call is involved, forget it. What am I, a switchboard operater? Last year we realized we were getting charged $813 by the city for sewer service that we don't use. We have an older house that still uses a septic system, but most of our neighbors are tied into the city sewer. It's a simple mistake but I had to call to get it resolved. I waited months to make the 7 minute phone call to get my $813 back. 7 minutes. That's $6,968.57 an hour. That's $14,494,625.60 a year. Sadly, that means I'd have to make 17,829 phone calls and this analogy has officially petered out.
- The point is, it took nearly zero effort to tackle that task and yet I waited months because I didn't want to face it head on.
- 

Scaring our children with our driving is a Campbell tradition. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
