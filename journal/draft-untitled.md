November 17, 2013. Austin, Texas.

At 2:43pm, Sebastian Vettel takes the chequered flag at the United States Grand Prix, setting a new record for most consecutive Formula One wins in a season and putting an exclamation point on his fourth consecutive World Championship title. As he cools the car and waves to the crowd on the meandering lap back into the pits, he pulls into a run-off area to perform some celebratory donuts in his Red Bull RB9. In the moments preceding this display, he sends out a radio call to his team:

| We have to remember these days, we have to remember these days, because there's no guarantee that they will last forever. Enjoy them as long as they last. I love you guys.

If you've ever heard record-setting athletes interviewed about their success, they always say some version of, "I just try to take things one [race, game, match] at a time and let others focus on the records. Maybe I'll look back on them when I'm older, but right now I'm focused on doing the best job I can." And this makes sense. You can't exactly murder your competition if you're spending time with your head in the clouds, admiring all your achievements. 100% of your focus has to be on, you know, the murdering. Which is why I was shocked when I heard Vettel, who was only 26 at the time, heave all that wise perspective over the radio. And as the years followed and dominance in the sport shifted to the Mercedes team, his outpouring of gratitude that day seems even more prophetic. That race was not his final win, but that season turned out to be his final championship-winning effort. (maybe cut this?)Knowing this, I get inexplicably emotional when I revisit his quote. It's the same feeling of satisfaction I get when a key unlocks a door or a puzzle piece fits.

I will not ever know Vettel's level of success. You - you, reading this now - will also never know success like that. Luckily, however, the recognition, reverence, and gratitude he expressed for the special moments in his career is not so untouchable to us unwashed masses.

We moved into this house about two years ago and the improvement projects are still coming at us fast and thick. For supplies, I usually go to the Lowes in a neighboring town west of us. The drive is either 10 or 13 minutes depending on which of the two routes I take. One route is a straight shot on a two-lane highway, while the other is a lazy river of hills, farms, and twisty back roads. My mood is the sole arbitor of which way I go, as rationality is relegated to standing on its tippy-toes and peering through the decision window from the outside. Sometimes I throw him a bone and go the quick way if I forgot something and have to make a second trip. Otherwise, I go which way the wind takes me. This carefree mindset is fertile ground for reflection.

On the way there, I'm in mission mode. I have a job to do and that job needs gear. Acquiring the gear is my focus and I don't want to miss anything and waste my time making another trip, so on the way there I'm usually running through the list in my head, considering the other yet-to-be listed things I might need. When the gear is on board and the car door shuts, however, it's mission accomplished. What happens next has two variations. Variation one: I turn onto the service road and take the third roundabout exit, which takes me to the traffic light where 90% of the time I have to wait to make my left turn and start the journey home. Variation two: I turn onto the service road and take the _second_ roundabout exit, which takes me to the shopping center that has the soft pretzel shop.

Now, I don't want to claim that _every_ time I get a pretzel on the way home I enter an out-of-body zen state during which I see the beginning and end of all space and time, speak to all beings both present and past in all languages, and hear the thoughts of the trees lining every farm I pass, but sometimes I get a pretzel fresh out of the oven, so that's bound to happen at least semi-frequently.

Anyway, once I have my orgasmic pretzel and I get to the traffic light, I have at least 10 minutes of driving before I get home and have to put my newly obtained gear to work. The last few minutes of the drive are spoken for, as my mind shifts back into mission mode to ponder what part of my project I'll undertake first, but the first five minutes are completely open. This five minute window between the traffic light and my project-arrested mind is a paradise of freedom. At my age with my job and my family, it's unfathomably rare for me to experience any stretch of time where I have zero decisions to make. Yet as I make the left at the light and take my third bite, that tiny stretch of decisionless time commences. And it's in this space I have room to stretch out, reflect on what's great about the universe, and "remember these days". 




Because there's no guarantee they'll last forever.

<!-- Notes for next time 3: Mostly there - stretch out the reflection - what do you think about? What are you thankful for? How do you feel as you take bites of the pretzel and stare at the clouds?  -->
<!-- Notes for next time 2: Got the transition, now go into the tiny slices and how to be grateful. Don't just brag, maybe show how-to?  -->
<!-- Notes for next time 1: Those sentiments came at the end of an unprecedented run of success, but they apply to even the smallest slice of time.  -->

- Cherishing the in-betweens
    - Recognize and soak in the minutes of true freedom
        - The first 5 minutes of coming home from Lowes, pretzel in my hand, windows open
        - Sebastian Vettel doing donuts after his 4th and final world championship (use this as the intro, also check that it was his 4th and not 3rd)


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
