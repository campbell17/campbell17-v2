When the power goes out, I go out.

This used to mean something different.

I live amongst many trees, and these many trees have many branches. When the wind picks up, one of the branches often makes its way to earth, stopping only briefly on its way down to collapse a power line and cut off some poor bastard's electricity. It's me. I'm the bastard.

On occasion, the power came back within a minute or so and we all pretended nothing happened. When it didn't, however, the subroutine for prolonged power loss went into effect. Panicked coordination with my friend next door followed while we ran hundreds of feet of extension cords from his portable generator to my refrigerator and garage freezer. Then we put everything on hold for however long it took for the power company to remedy the problem.

This was...suboptimal. Life completely stopped when this happened, including the ability to get any work done. But I live amongst many trees, and these trees have many branches. This problem wasn't going to go away on its own.

When we first moved here, we discussed getting a generator to help mitigate the upheaval. This kicked off a long round of research about how much we needed, wanted, and could afford. We weighed the tradeoffs of getting a whole-house solution vs. portable. Gas vs. propane. Fuel-based vs. a renewable/battery backup combo. And on it went, down to me standing in the basement with my laptop making a spreadsheet about which breakers run which appliances and how much power each is likely to draw.

But before we could even buy the generator, we had to call an electrician to outfit our panel with the transfer switch necessary to connect an external power source in the first place. With that done, we were ready.

Then something occurred to me. What if we went through all this trouble, spent a bunch of money on the generator, and the next storm never came? I decided we should wait. We had everything we needed, down to the specs of the generator, but in my mind we could defer that purchase until the next extended power outage. It's the old "wait until it's raining to buy an umbrella" technique. The wise among you will note that by waiting until it rains, you're already soaked by the time you open the umbrella.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
