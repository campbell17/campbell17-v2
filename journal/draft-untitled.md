Someone once paid me an innocent compliment that made me re-examine my life and the lives of everyone else. Not counting sociopaths and narcissists, though there are plenty to go around, most adults I meet are fairly self-depricating, measured, and humble. Sometimes I have the privilege of spending enough time with someone to push beyond simple cocktail party small-talk. This small-talk, by the way, can last indefinitely depending on the level of affinity and chemistry between people. I've had neighbors I talked to nearly every day for a year and never got beyond yesterday's football scores. This kind of social limbo can be excrutiating when I'm not a fan of the other person. I didn't dislike them, per se, but I'd sooner let those dead skin-eating fish[1] loose on my face than have dinner with the guy. But I digress. If we hit it off, we might exchange info about our hobbies, number of children, favorite vacation spots, and so on. After that, though, my brain fills in the blanks of the rest of their life story with a series of defaults based on _my_ experience, not theirs. This is perfectly understandable since that's how the brain negotiates the complexity of living, assigning placeholder data based on our assumptions and biases. But twenty years ago I crossed paths with someone who, with one comment, snapped a new perspective into my consciousness.

When I learn new things about people, the transaction is fairly straightforward. They tell me something. I remember it. I use it to fill in some detail like a sculptor peels a curve from a flat block of clay. Learning about myself is a bit more of a mystery. My brain is shifty, using all kinds of tricks, compensations, and justifications as a damper to shield my sense of self from harshness of Being. To avoid the creeping spector of nihilism and without my explicit consent, my ego claims victories I don't deserve and abstracts blame for mistakes. Consciousness is a constant chess match between two equally-skilled opponents. White plays first, telling me I'm not generous enough and I could stand to be a lot more humble. Black counters with a long, vivid daydream about the time I fully stretched out on my backhand for a ground ball up the middle, popping up in time to throw the guy out at first. White, quite cruelly, reminds me we still lost the game.

Bill Watterson spoke to this struggle when he described his depiction of Calvin using his Duplicatorâ„¢ to create a clone and pawn his homework and chores off on his other self: "I Think most of us would be horrified to meet ourselves and discover what everyone else aready knows about us."

While we were in the darkroom making prints back in college, I told a pedestrian story to break the monotony after which a quiet remark floated into my ear from a nearby corner. "Wow, it sounds like you've led a full life." As a reflex I replied, "Huh. Thanks!" The moment passed and we all kept working, but I couldn't reconcile what I'd just heard.

[1] Garra rufa. Yes, I googled "fish that eat dead skin". Buyer beware, apparently.

Notes for next time: NOTE: Be careful about diminishing the other person while propping yourself up

It blew my mind, but maybe I don't have to say that explicitly. I couldn't believe someone thought my life was interesting, let alone FULL.

- Story teaser
- Intro to my perception of people
- Intro to my perception of me
- Surprise to hear that someone thought my life was full - this is incongruous to how I view myself (figure out me's vs. myselfs for this)
- Realization that in order to pay me such a compliment, there must be high contrast between my experiences and that of the compliment giver
- Something about how such a tiny remark has such wide and lasting impact due to it's misalignment with the image of self
- "Oh, she just doesn't realize I'm a lazy piece of shit yet. Once she got to know me, she wouldn't think my life was so full."
- But maybe I shouldn't take the experiences I've had for granted as much as I do. Not everyone is as lucky or has the freedoms and opportunities I have
