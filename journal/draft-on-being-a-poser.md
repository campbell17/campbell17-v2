Being the inadvertant poser

- No matter how I approach something, I end up being a poser.
- talking all the time about doing instead of actually doing
- taking forever on everything
- everything seems bigger than it is
- always starting, starting, starting, never getting past the first level
- I get stuck on the process. The completely irrelevant process.
- I bought some gouache for Christmas. "I'm gonna learn gouache. I'm gonna make a painting every week!" There they sit atop the desk, untouched for months.
- My colored pencils are older than some nations
- I tried to write every day in 2020. It lasted 12 posts. Ok I'll write every other day. That lasted 4. Then instead of 4 in 8 days, it's 4 in 15. Then 30. Then it's 1 in 30 days. A last gasp when the new year hits bumps me back up to 5 in 30. Then it's 5 in 5 months. A big family move 1,000 miles north puts the final nail in the coffin. The familiar death spiral of an ambition not supported by a reliable routine.
- Every time I think I have it figured out, natural changes in my temperament undercut my progress
- My office is a shrine to the possible. French cleats up the wall, poised to hold a plethora of canvas sizes. First-order-retrievability for Copic markers, colored pencils, acrylic paint, oil paint, brushes, inks, pastels, illustration board, sketchbooks. (Maybe add "color" to the paint colors by naming a few?)
- The excuses I tell myself. The justifications. "Well, I don't want to focus on too many things at once."
- The paralyzing number of ambitions. "I want to draw graphite portraits like Stephen Bauman. Now I want to paint immaculate gouache vignettes like Syballine. Now I want to set up a darkroom in my basement so I can shoot, process, and print my own black and white photographs using my old Canon AE-1. Now I want to refresh my anatomy knowledge so I can draw more dynamic figure poses. Now I want to make nostalgic fan art like Glen Brogan." It never ends.
- Do other people have this problem? I feel like the most prolific poser of all time.
- I want to write. Writing is isolated but subject to the same pattern of inefficiency. What to write about? What tone of voice?
- Do it all. But not at the same time. One project at a time. Patience is required. Possibly the highest requirement is patience. Impatience is what cuts me down at the knees. Impatience is what causes me to start new thing after new thing after new thing. Patience is making a list and sticking to it. I will only ship one art project per month because that is all I'm capable of doing.
- But James Jean ships new paintings every week it seems. And prints using new mixed media techniques he invented. And sculptures based on his other works. And and and and.
- The comparison to others is the easiest and most effective method of sabotage available. It's in the handbook they give to memebers of the CIA. Members of the poser CIA.
- What can I ship? Not what do I wish I could ship? Not what are others shipping? Not what amazing things are people posting every day on Instagram? Not why can't I just ship more so I can post about it on social media? What can I ship? That is good enough. That has to be good enough. Because if that isn't good enough, I'm looking for ways to improve it. And if I'm looking for ways to improve it I'm not shipping.
- The clock just struck 6:30am. In thirty minutes, my writing time is up and my art project time begins. Because I've let ambition creep back into my routine somehow, I don't know what I'm supposed to be working on. I have to stop what I'm doing, look at my list, and remember which project is in progress. That is a red flag.
- I'm stuck on a project. I can't get past the first stage of sketches. And because progress has stopped, I've been syphoning my art time into my writing time to catch up for lack of writing production. This is bad for my writing and bad for my art. I can't do art if I steal its time away, and I adding time to my writing block removes the urgency necessary to crystalize my thoughts effectively. I can let my mind wander because I have more time than usual.
- "Only YOU know how lazy you are." I believe I am incredibly lazy. But compared to what? Compared to my ambitions. Compared to other artists. Compared to other writers. Compared to other designers. They all have better work. They all accomplished way more by much younger ages. They all ship more often. They all work harder. They all want it more. They all do it more. I bet they're drawing, shooting, painting, writing, shipping as we speak. While I sleep. While I eat. While I watch TV. While I play with my kids. Every moment I'm not creating, they are. 
- What are all these art supplies doing in my office? I'm not using them. 
- They belong. I'm not using them. Not for this project. This project doesn't need them. But someday, I'll ship a project that needs them. Maybe I'll pick one whose sole purpose is using them up. That Liquitex burnt siena with the old tube design needs to get used up. Maybe I'll invent a project to take care of that tube. And maybe I won't buy a new one right away.

Notes for next time: Hmm...This isn't quite an outline, but maybe that's ok? Spend a FEW...a FEW...minutes thinking about the beats - see if you can add some clear transition beats quickly, maybe think of a way to tie things together. If that blows up, just keep vomiting the words out. So far I'm liking what's coming out.
