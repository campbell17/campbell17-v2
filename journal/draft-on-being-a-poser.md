No matter how I approach something, I end up being a poser. I'll Talk to anyone who will listen about the project. I'll act like I don't want to talk about it but I DESPERATELY want to talk about it. But it's all talking instead of doing. Talking feels _almost_ like doing, so it's close enough to trick my brain into _thinking_ I'm doing. But I'm not doing. And if by some miracle I do start doing, I take forever on everything. And when I take forever on something, it seems bigger than it is. Which leads to not finishing. It's always starting, starting, starting, but never getting past the first level. I have a drawing mounted to plywood, prepped and ready to become a painting. I mounted that drawing before the pandemic. I start to obsess about the process. But the process is irrelevant since I'm talking, not doing. I bought some gouache last year. "I'm gonna practice painting with gouache. I'm gonna paint something every week." I painted one study in my sketchbook. It took a few weeks. And over there, five feet away from where I sit as I write this, rests brand new tubes of gouache. Untouched for months. Why would I ever buy new art supplies? I have acrylic paint from art stores that have since gone out of business. I have colored pencils that are older than the nation of Serbia. My studio is a shrine to the possible. French cleats on the wall, poised to hold a plethora of canvas sizes. First-order retrievability for Copic markers, colored pencils, acrylic paint, oil paint, brushes, inks, and pastels. Canvas paper, illustration board, sketchbooks, and Arches hot press drawing paper. That's the smoother finish. Less "tooth" than the cold press. All in the service of...what, exactly? Only a poser would have all the gear and never use it.

My excuses are hilariously vapid. I don't have the right tools. I don't have the right supplies. I don't have a place to put anything. I should get organized first. I don't have enough time. The time excuse is the worst, as though leisure time is some immovable monolith. I couldn't possibly abstain from watching movies or TV every day. Oh and I love sports, so I have to watch those. HAVE to. "It's football season, so no fewer than 12 hours per week is booked solid. It's hockey season, so I have to set aside 2.5 hours every other night to watch the games. It's Formula 1 season, so that's 3 more hours per weekend since I have to watch the race AND qualifying. It's the Master's. It's the US Open. It's a Major. It's the playoffs. It's the World Cup. It's the Olympics." 

It's a miracle I even have time to eat solid food and use the bathroom. 

"Well, I don't want to focus on too many things at once." But in the next breath, I rattle off a paralyzing number of ambitions: "I want to draw graphite portraits like Stephen Bauman. I want to paint immaculate gouache vignettes like Syballine. I want to set up a darkroom in my basement so I can shoot, process, and print my own black and white photographs using my old Canon AE-1. I want to refresh my anatomy knowledge so I can draw more dynamic figure poses. I want to make nostalgic fan art like Glen Brogan." It never ends.

My poserdom isn't limited to the visual arts. I want to write. Writing is at least a single medium, but it falls prey to the same pattern of inefficiency. What to write about? What's the subject? What's the tone? I tried to write a blog post every day in the summer of 2020. That lasted 12 posts. "Maybe I'll write every other day." That lasted 4. Then instead of 4 posts in 8 days, it was 4 in 15. Then 30. Then only 1 every 30 days. A last gasp when the new year hits bumps me back up to 5 posts in 30 days, but that quickly turns into 5 posts in 5 months. Finally, a family move 1,000 miles north put the doomed endeavor to rest. 

The familiar death spiral of a creative ambition is caused by an unreliable routine. Every time I think I have a routine figured out, natural changes in my temperament lead to its alteration and eventual abandonment. I need to find a routine that's reliable. Repeatable. Bulletproof. I want to complete all my projects. But not at the same time. One project at a time. Patience is required. Patience is paramount. Impatience is what cuts me down at the knees. Impatience is what causes me to start new thing after new thing after new thing. Patience is making a list and sticking to it. Patience is making a list - a list I might even have a prayer of completing - and sticking to it. "I will only ship one art project per month because that is all I'm capable of doing." That sounds possible. I can work with that.

But then the comparison train rolls into the station.

"But James Jean ships new paintings every week. He ships new paintings and makes prints with novel mixed media techniques. He ships new paintings, makes prints, and commissions sculptures based on his paintings. He ships new paintings, makes prints, commissions sculptures, and still has time for commercial work." Comparison to others is the easiest and most effective method of sabotage available. It's in the handbook they give to memebers of the CIA. Members of the poser CIA. My brain is a member of the poser CIA. 

I recall a well-meaning quote from Adam Savage regarding self doubt and how misaligned our perceptions are of how _other_ people perceive us. "Only YOU know how lazy you are." This essentially means give yourself a break. Others will never see the comparison between your ambition and your output because it only exists in the mind of the individual. Case in point, I often believe I'm a poser. But compared to what? That's the rub. When I play the comparison game, I only weigh myself against inflated assumptions. I will always be a poser compared to my industrious but non-existent other self. And compared to other artists, writers, and designers who are world famous for their fantastic work. I assume they all accomplished way more by much younger ages. And they ship more often. And they work harder. They love it more, want it more, and do it more. I bet they're drawing, shooting, painting, writing, shipping as we speak. While I sleep. While I eat. While I watch TV. While I play with my kids. Every moment I'm not creating, they are.

Yes. _They_ are. But in all these unfair comparisons, I never consider the waterline. These famous creators at the upper echelon of their field are the tip of the output iceberg. Below the surface lurks an unwashed mass of humanity that are somehow even less productive than I am. So I must return my gaze to focus only on the extent of _my_ capability. What can I finish? Not what do I wish I could finish? Not what are others finishing? What can _I_ finish? That is good enough. That has to be good enough. Because if that isn't good enough, I'll look for ways to expand it. And if I'm spending time looking for ways to expand it, that's time spent not finishing.

The clock just struck 6:30am. In thirty minutes, my writing time is up and my art project time begins. Even though I have time set aside every day for this, I don't remember what I'm supposed to be working on. That is a red flag. I pull up my project list and as I review my priorities, I remember why I couldn't remember. I'm stuck. I can't get past the first stage of sketches. And because progress has slowed, I've started syphoning my art time into my writing time to catch up for lack of writing production. This is bad for my writing and bad for my art. I can't make art if I steal its time away, and adding extra time to my writing block removes the built-in urgency I utilize to crystalize my thoughts effectively; without that, I can let my mind wander because I have more time than usual. And a wandering mind usually leads me back into counterproductive comparisons and defeatist lines of existential inquiry.

"Why do I keep trying?" 
"Why not abandon this part of my life and throw away all these unused art supplies?" 
"Why not lower my expectations?" 
"Why keep fighting to improve?"

This year I want to write more. This year I want to draw more. This year I want to finally make a painting that I think is good. 

"Why?"

Look at the imposter syndrome it puts me though. Look at the early mornings and dissapointments. Look at the shame, anxiety, and insecurity of being a poser. The pain of having ideas without acting on them. The Sisyphean efforts to get out of my own way and push through the creative wall.

There are two answers. One is echoed by every creative person who ever amounted to anything. Every prolific writer, artist, musician, and designer will all tell you the same thing: **do not** stop. One of my favorite creators, Van Neistat, summarizes this when (talking about his routine and the war against burnout) <-- link: https://youtu.be/B9RSWg9OXj8. 

| One of the Masterclass writers - or maybe several of them - have hammered home that the routine _is_ the job. Routine over everything.

The second answer to the question of why is as follows:

| The elderly man is tired and battered from the tribulations of his latest work.
| He picks up his quill, dabs the edge of the inkwell, and begins again.
| "Why do you do this?" asks the boy.
| "Because," the man replies, "the mental pain I endure when I work is a mere fraction of the spiritual pain I endure when I don't."




- No matter how I approach something, I end up being a poser.
- talking all the time about doing instead of actually doing
- Talking to anyone who will listen about our projects. Acting like we don't want to talk about it but DESPERATELY wanting to talk about it.
- Talking ALMOST feels like doing, and it's close enough to trick my brain into thinking I'm doing.
- taking forever on everything
- everything seems bigger than it is
- always starting, starting, starting, never getting past the first level
- I get stuck on the process. The completely irrelevant process.
- I bought some gouache last year. "I'm gonna learn gouache. I'm gonna make a painting every week!" I painted one study in my sketchbook. There my new paints sit, five feet away on my drawing table, untouched for months.
- My colored pencils are older than some nations
- I tried to write every day in 2020. It lasted 12 posts. "Maybe I'll write every other day." That lasted 4. Then instead of 4 in 8 days, it's 4 in 15. Then 30. Then it's 1 in 30 days. A last gasp when the new year hits bumps me back up to 5 in 30. Then it's 5 in 5 months. A big family move 1,000 miles north puts the final nail in the coffin. The familiar death spiral of a creative ambition is caused by an unreliable routine.
- Every time I think I have a routine figured out, natural changes in my temperament lead to its alteration and eventual abandonment.
- My office is a shrine to the possible. French cleats up the wall, poised to hold a plethora of canvas sizes. First-order-retrievability for Copic markers, colored pencils, acrylic paint, oil paint, brushes, inks, pastels, illustration board, sketchbooks. (Maybe add "color" to the paint colors by naming a few?)
- The excuses I tell myself. The justifications. "Well, I don't want to focus on too many things at once."
- The paralyzing number of ambitions. "I want to draw graphite portraits like Stephen Bauman. Now I want to paint immaculate gouache vignettes like Syballine. Now I want to set up a darkroom in my basement so I can shoot, process, and print my own black and white photographs using my old Canon AE-1. Now I want to refresh my anatomy knowledge so I can draw more dynamic figure poses. Now I want to make nostalgic fan art like Glen Brogan." It never ends.
- Do other people have this problem? I feel like the most prolific poser of all time.
- I want to write. Writing is isolated but subject to the same pattern of inefficiency. What to write about? What tone of voice?
- Do it all. But not at the same time. One project at a time. Patience is required. Patience is paramount. Impatience is what cuts me down at the knees. Impatience is what causes me to start new thing after new thing after new thing. Patience is making a list and sticking to it. I will only ship one art project per month because that is all I'm capable of doing.
- But James Jean ships new paintings every week it seems. And prints using new mixed media techniques he invented. And sculptures based on his other works. And and and and.
- The comparison to others is the easiest and most effective method of sabotage available. It's in the handbook they give to memebers of the CIA. Members of the poser CIA.
- What can I ship? Not what do I wish I could ship? Not what are others shipping? Not what amazing things are people posting every day on Instagram? Not why can't I just ship more so I can post about it on social media? What can I ship? That is good enough. That has to be good enough. Because if that isn't good enough, I'm looking for ways to improve it. And if I'm spending time looking for ways to improve it, that's time spent not shipping.
- The clock just struck 6:30am. In thirty minutes, my writing time is up and my art project time begins. Because I've let ambition creep back into my routine somehow, I don't know what I'm supposed to be working on. I have to stop what I'm doing, look at my list, and remember which project is in progress. That is a red flag.
- I'm stuck on a project. I can't get past the first stage of sketches. And because progress has stopped, I've been syphoning my art time into my writing time to catch up for lack of writing production. This is bad for my writing and bad for my art. I can't do art if I steal its time away, and I adding time to my writing block removes the urgency necessary to crystalize my thoughts effectively. I can let my mind wander because I have more time than usual.
- "Only YOU know how lazy you are." I believe I am incredibly lazy. But compared to what? Compared to my industrious but non-existent other self. Compared to other artists. Compared to other writers. Compared to other designers. They all have better work. They all accomplished way more by much younger ages. They all ship more often. They all work harder. They all want it more. They all do it more. I bet they're drawing, shooting, painting, writing, shipping as we speak. While I sleep. While I eat. While I watch TV. While I play with my kids. Every moment I'm not creating, they are. 

- What are all these art supplies doing in my office? I'm not using them. Between the years of 2000 and 2012 I didn't pick up a paint brush or a drawing pencil. Why did I keep all these art supplies? I'm not a hoarder. 
- They belong. I'm not using them. Not for this project. This project doesn't need them. But someday, I'll ship a project that needs them. Maybe I'll pick one whose sole purpose is using them up. That Liquitex burnt siena with the old tube design needs to get used up. Maybe I'll invent a project to take care of that tube.
- But probably I won't. Posers don't follow through. Posers don't do what they say. Posers make plans but that's all they make. Posers have unlimited ideas but no shipping skills. Gonna help Chris with his website. But I never call Chris. Gonna help Jason with his app design. But I never open Figma. Gonna flesh out this idea for a mobile game. But I never open Google Docs.

- The excuses are hilariously vapid. I don't have the right tools. I don't have the right supplies. I don't have a place to put anything. I should get organized first. I don't have enough time. The time excuse is the worst. To this poser, leisure time is an immovable monolith. I couldn't possibly abstain from watching movies or TV every day. Oh and I love sports, so I have to watch those. HAVE to. It's football season, so no fewer than 12 hours per week is booked solid. It's hockey season, so I have to set aside 2.5 hours every other night to watch the games. It's Formula 1 season that's 3 more hours per weekend since I have to watch the race AND qualifying. It's the Master's. It's the US Open. It's a Major. It's the playoffs. It's the World Cup. It's the Olympics. It's the Eagles. It's the Penguins. It's the Yankees. It's a miracle I even have time to eat solid food and use the bathroom.

- Do other people have this problem? (reprise) 

- I'm a poser compared to...who? Who is so authentic and prolific that I can't bear to utter my name in the same breath as theirs? Is it even about comparison? Can I still be a poser even I ship more work? That depends. Does the amount of talking also increase? If so, I might still be a poser. Wait. Who do I even talk to about my work? Myself. I tell myself all about the things I want to do. I tell myself all about the cool projects it would be nice to _have done_.

- The only antidote to this poison is to ship work. To be too busy shipping to talk about what you did or what you're about to do. "Can't talk about it yet." (link to "the panicked creative" article) 


Possible ending. POSSIBLE...ending. Don't get too attached.
- Why do I keep trying? Why not kill this side of my life and throw away my unused art supplies? Why not lower my expectations? If I must make things, why not do so at my current skill level and give up the fight to improve? "This year I want to write more. This year I want to draw more. This year I want to finally make a painting that I think is good." WHY? Look at the imposter syndrome it puts me though. Look at the early mornings and dissapointments. Look at the shame, anxiety, and insecurity of being a poser. The pain of having ideas without acting on them. The Sisyphean efforts to get out of my own way and push through the creative wall. 
- Ending line is something like - "...but the pain is so much to bear. It consumes him. He feels almost as bad as he did when he didn't try." <- I don't know how to word this yet, but the entire premise is based on "Since you been gone...I feel almost as bad as I did...when you were still here."

Note: Once there was an elderly man... (Tell this story with a story? A REAL story? "And he kept trying. He did not lower his expectations. He refused to give up the fight to improve." etc)

Notes for next time: Attempt to compose an outline for the narrative version. 

He picks up his quill, dabs the edge of the inkwell, and begins again.

"Why do you do this?," asks the boy. 

"Because," the old man replies, "the mental pain I endure when I work is a mere fraction of the spiritual pain I endure when I don't."


Notes for next time: Write it all out and see how it reads.

Notes for next time: complete writing it all out. The surprise/ending is: you do not stop. Do NOT stop. For every 10 superstars I unrealistically comparise myself against, there are 100,000 people doing fuck-all with their life compared to me.
