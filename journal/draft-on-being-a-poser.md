Being the inadvertant poser

- No matter how I approach something, I end up being a poser.
- talking all the time about doing instead of actually doing
- taking forever on everything
- everything seems bigger than it is
- always starting, starting, starting, never getting past the first level
- I get stuck on the process. The completely irrelevant process.
- I bought some gouache for Christmas. "I'm gonna learn gouache. I'm gonna make a painting every week!" There they sit atop the desk, untouched for months.
- My colored pencils are older than some nations
- I tried to write every day in 2020. It lasted 12 posts. Ok I'll write every other day. That lasted 4. Then instead of 4 in 8 days, it's 4 in 15. Then 30. Then it's 1 in 30 days. A last gasp when the new year hits bumps me back up to 5 in 30. Then it's 5 in 5 months. A big family move 1,000 miles north puts the final nail in the coffin. The familiar death spiral of an ambition not supported by a reliable routine.
- Every time I think I have it figured out, natural changes in my temperament undercut my progress
- My office is a shrine to the possible. French cleats up the wall, poised to hold a plethora of canvas sizes. First-order-retrievability for Copic markers, colored pencils, acrylic paint, oil paint, brushes, inks, pastels, illustration board, sketchbooks. (Maybe add "color" to the paint colors by naming a few?)
- The excuses I tell myself. The justifications. "Well, I don't want to focus on too many things at once."
- The paralyzing number of ambitions. "I want to draw graphite portraits like Stephen Bauman. Now I want to paint immaculate gouache vignettes like Syballine. Now I want to set up a darkroom in my basement so I can shoot, process, and print my own black and white photographs using my old Canon AE-1. Now I want to refresh my anatomy knowledge so I can draw more dynamic figure poses. Now I want to make nostalgic fan art like Glen Brogan." It never ends.
- Do other people have this problem? I feel like the most prolific poser of all time.
- I want to write. Writing is isolated but subject to the same pattern of inefficiency. What to write about? What tone of voice?
- Do it all. But not at the same time. One project at a time. Patience is required. Possibly the highest requirement is patience. Impatience is what cuts me down at the knees. Impatience is what causes me to start new thing after new thing after new thing. Patience is making a list and sticking to it. I will only ship one art project per month because that is all I'm capable of doing.
- But James Jean ships new paintings every week it seems. And prints using new mixed media techniques he invented. And sculptures based on his other works. And and and and.
- The comparison to others is the easiest and most effective method of sabotage available. It's in the handbook they give to memebers of the CIA. Members of the poser CIA.
- What can I ship? Not what do I wish I could ship? Not what are others shipping? Not what amazing things are people posting every day on Instagram? Not why can't I just ship more so I can post about it on social media? What can I ship? That is good enough. That has to be good enough. Because if that isn't good enough, I'm looking for ways to improve it. And if I'm looking for ways to improve it I'm not shipping.
- The clock just struck 6:30am. In thirty minutes, my writing time is up and my art project time begins. Because I've let ambition creep back into my routine somehow, I don't know what I'm supposed to be working on. I have to stop what I'm doing, look at my list, and remember which project is in progress. That is a red flag.
- I'm stuck on a project. I can't get past the first stage of sketches. And because progress has stopped, I've been syphoning my art time into my writing time to catch up for lack of writing production. This is bad for my writing and bad for my art. I can't do art if I steal its time away, and I adding time to my writing block removes the urgency necessary to crystalize my thoughts effectively. I can let my mind wander because I have more time than usual.
- "Only YOU know how lazy you are." I believe I am incredibly lazy. But compared to what? Compared to my ambitions. Compared to other artists. Compared to other writers. Compared to other designers. They all have better work. They all accomplished way more by much younger ages. They all ship more often. They all work harder. They all want it more. They all do it more. I bet they're drawing, shooting, painting, writing, shipping as we speak. While I sleep. While I eat. While I watch TV. While I play with my kids. Every moment I'm not creating, they are. 
- What are all these art supplies doing in my office? I'm not using them. Between the years of 2000 and 2012 I didn't pick up a paint brush or a drawing pencil. Why did I keep all these art supplies? I'm not a hoarder. 
- They belong. I'm not using them. Not for this project. This project doesn't need them. But someday, I'll ship a project that needs them. Maybe I'll pick one whose sole purpose is using them up. That Liquitex burnt siena with the old tube design needs to get used up. Maybe I'll invent a project to take care of that tube.
- But probably I won't. Posers don't follow through. Posers don't do what they say. Posers make plans but that's all they make. Posers have unlimited ideas but no shipping skills. Gonna help Chris with his website. But I never call Chris. Gonna help Jason with his app design. But I never open Figma. Gonna flesh out this idea for a mobile game. But I never open Google Docs.
- The excuses are hilariously vapid. I don't have the right tools. I don't have the right supplies. I don't have a place to put anything. I should get organized first. I don't have enough time. The time excuse is the worst. To this poser, leisure time is an immovable monolith. I couldn't possibly abstain from watching movies or TV every day. Oh and I love sports, so I have to watch those. HAVE to. It's football season, so no fewer than 12 hours per week is booked solid. It's hockey season, so I have to set aside 2.5 hours every other night to watch the games. It's Formula 1 season that's 3 more hours per weekend since I have to watch the race AND qualifying. It's the Master's. It's the US Open. It's a Major. It's the playoffs. It's the World Cup. It's the Olympics. It's the Eagles. It's the Penguins. It's the Yankees. It's a miracle I even have time to eat solid food and use the bathroom.
- Do other people have this problem? (reprise) 
- I'm a poser compared to...who? Who is so authentic and prolific that I can't bear to utter my name in the same breath as theirs? Is it even about comparison? Can I still be a poser even I ship more work? That depends. Does the amount of talking also increase? If so, I might still be a poser. Wait. Who do I even talk to about my work? Myself. I tell myself all about the things I want to do. I tell myself all about the cool projects it would be nice "to have done", not "to do". 
- The only antidote to this poison is shipped work. Be too busy shipping to talk about what you did or what you're about to do. "Can't talk about it yet." (link to "the panicked creative" article) 


Possible ending. POSSIBLE...ending. Don't get too attached.
- Why do I keep trying? Why not kill this side of my life and throw away my unused art supplies? Why not lower my expectations? Why not make things at my current skill level and give up the fight to improve? "This year I want to write more. This year I want to draw more. This year I want to finally make a painting that I think is good." WHY? Look at the imposter syndrome it puts me though. Look at the early mornings and dissapointments. Look at the shame, anxiety, and insecurity of being a poser. The pain of having ideas without acting on them. The Sisyphean efforts to get out of my own way and push through the creative wall. 
- Ending line is something like - "...but the pain is so much to bear. It consumes him. He feels almost as bad as he did when he didn't try." <- I don't know how to word this yet, but the entire premise is based on "Since you been gone...I feel almost as bad as I did...when you were still here."

Note: Once there was an elderly man... (Tell this story with a story? A REAL story? "And he kept trying. He did not lower his expectations. He refused to give up the fight to improve." etc)

Notes for next time: Attempt to compose an outline for the narrative version.
