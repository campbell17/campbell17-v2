You look through the window. It's dark. It's late. Or it's early.

Across the street you see lights, but only two. 

They're far. Maybe a quarter-mile. Maybe less.

They light a door. 

It will be some time before the sun comes up.

The lights are perfectly level. Well spaced apart. But they're wrong.

They're a pair. But they don't match.

Mesmerizing are their differences. Calling for more than one glance. More than two glances. Now a full stare.

They were the same once. A pair. And a match. But one changed. Or the other changed. Or they both changed in different ways.

One is too warm. Or the other is too cool.

They were the same once. Both lit. And both matched.

But one changed. 

Maybe one bulb died.

And maybe time passed, and no one noticed.

And cold from disuse, the bulb was unscrewed.

Replaced with a spare.

A different spare.

So now they don't match.

Through the window. Across the street. Far away. And in the dark. They don't match.

But they're still a pair.

They're still a pair, and they don't stop.

They don't stop. They light the door.





But they don't stop. They light the door.


But in the dark, they have a job. They illuminate the door.

But the door is dark. 

Something is out there.

Something out there stands between you and the door.

But you can't see it. 


<!-- Pre-you/me/we: -->
Look out the window. It's dark. It's late. Or maybe early.

Across the street there are lights, but only two. 

They're far. Maybe a quarter-mile. Maybe less.

The lights are in front of a door, but the door is still dark. And it will be some time before the sun comes up.

The lights are perfectly level. Well spaced apart. But they're wrong.

They're a pair. But they don't match.

Mezmerizing are their differences. Calling for more than one glance. More than two glances. Now a full stare.

They were the same once. A pair. And a match. But one changed. Or the other changed. Or they both changed in different ways.

One is too warm. Or the other is too cool.

They were the same once. Both lit. And both matched.

But one bulb died. So that bulb got replaced.

Now they don't match.

But in the dark, they have a job. They illuminate the door.

But the door is dark. Because there's something out there.

Something blocking the view.




Look out the window. It's dark. And the lights are all that's out there.

But there's a door. You can't see it yet. But it's there.

The lights work. But the door is dark.


<!-- Notes for next time: Maybe don't do the repetition on "they're both lit"? -->


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
