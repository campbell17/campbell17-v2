Getting into trouble...but not _too_ much trouble.

Screenshot of the sandlot, early in when Lea whatsherface is talking to Smalls

- What are the odds I ended up here instead of in juvenile detention?
- In 5th grade, I was in the middle of figuring out who I was. Then we moved.
- To avoid getting teased, or to get attention, or to try to make new friends (who the hell knows why I did these things), I perpetrated all manner of childhood "crimes".
- Some of these were inherent to my nature as a curious and mischievous boy. Others were thoughtless, bizarre, and dangerous.
- When I try to assess myself as a person, I assume I've always tried to be good, but I don't think that's accurate.
- At my 8th grade graduation, one of my classmates recited a poem describing everyone in our grade as we sat on the brink of moving to high school. "Tim is good at knowing what's right..." is how I was described in said poem. That made my parents happy, but I was slightly puzzled. Looking back, maybe I was puzzled because everyone at this school had only known me for 1.5 years up to that point.
- My behavior was so bad between 5th and 7th grade, I had to change schools. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for someone who supposedly does what's right.
- The memories I have of this time are almost all from 5th or 8th grade. Changing schools from 5th to 6th, and then again halfway through 7th, means the interim year and a half is a blur. The 7th grade switch marked a turning point and I think even I realized something had to change. I didn't want to be getting in trouble all the time, and although my streak of dishonesty (<-- gonna have to reconcile this with my decision in Berwyn to always tell the truth) continued for a while longer, I eventually came around.
- We moved again between 8th and 9th grade and I seized that opportunity (probably more unconscious maturity than explicit choice) to enjoy another clean slate. I wanted (most of) my choices to have defensible outcomes.
- Somehow I still did dumbass shit like driving my friend home (at a snail's pace) without my license, but other times I stood my ground, though collected some guilt by association (zima). 
- The part that interests me now that the insanity is behind me is the sheer luck of getting to the other side relatively unscathed. How much of this was always going to happen, i.e., if I _did_ end up in juvvy, would I still have turned over a new leaf when given the opportunity?
- Something else to consider - my parents hand in taking the necessary actions to turn the ship around. I changed schools almost as much as a military kid, in K, 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 8th grade. Two of those were relocation-induced, but one of those relocations was a direct result of the dissatisfaction my parents had with how things were going, not just for me.
- When I consider where I am and compare it to where I could have ended up, it seems nothing short of miraculous. 
- New leaf vs. let it ride. Something else to consider is the effect of getting out of something that could have been life-changing (in a bad way). When does a fortunate bounce lead to "never again", and when does it lead to "let's ride this train till it derails"?
- 

There but for the grace of God...go I. How is it I ended up here - in my own house with a cup of warmish coffee and a computer to write with - instead of on the streets, in prison, or dead? Have you thought about that lately? Think about all the times you got in trouble growing up. Some of it was typical kid-doing-dumb-stuff stuff, but I bet there were a few nasty near-misses as well. We all get in trouble, but what separates the people who learn from their near misses and "grow out of it" from the people who _stay_ in trouble into adulthood and beyond?

Growing up, I maintained a steady ebb and flow between sinner and saint. Left to my own devices I was a pretty good kid, but it didn't take much arm-twisting from friends to get the mischevious juices flowing. The younger I was, the more succeptible I was to going along with whoever had the idea, regardless of how bad it was. Because I have good parents, I got in trouble for my various misdeeds, and was able to learn where the guardrails were.

I still remember where I was standing in my old house when my mom laid the "birds of a feather flock together" adage at my feet. When explained its meaning I got my first glimpse into the way I could be influenced by others. She stressed I should be more particular about who I hang around with. Up until that point, fun was fun and anyone who wanted to play with me was a-ok. I remember resisting the idea at the time, not wanting someone else to have control over who I chose to be friends with. It sank in, though, and I avoided playing with that boy much after that. That was a "nurture" moment, as opposed to my inherent attraction to trouble, i.e. "nature". I read once that despite the obvious influence our peers have on our behavior, it's our natural attractions to those _types_ of peers that really determines what path we end up taking in life. In other words, if I was born with a predernatural yearning to be perceived as "cool" and I grew up in an era where smoking was considered cool, my peer group wouldn't be the ones influencing me to smoke; rather, when I reached an age where that started to matter, I would naturally gravitate toward a peer group already consisting of smokers.

Sudden transitions like changing schools or moving away are also breeding grounds for changes in behavior, though the changes aren't always bad. My parents gambled twice on changing schools with me mid-year, and both times yielded an improvement. We also moved twice - once in the middle of 5th grade and again just after 8th - but those had opposite effects. In 5th grade, I was deep in the process of figuring out who I was. I had some good friends (who I sometimes accidentally punched in the face)[link to essay], I played baseball, and had a pretty nice routine going. Then, halfway through the school year, my family moved across the state when my dad got transferred to another office. I remember being excited, but I didn't take to it well. The kids were different. They were less innocent. They had rough edges. And being shy and new attracted unfamiliar amounts of attention. I don't know if it was to avoid getting teased or to try to fit in, but I perpetrated all sorts of schoolyard "crimes" that were out of character even for me. It didn't help that I was changing schools again at the end of the year to go to middle school, which is a notoriously tumultuous period for American kids, and maybe I figured I had nothing to lose. Things didn't improve and halfway through 7th grade, my parents took their second gamble and changed me to a different school again.

When I try to assess myself honestly as a person, I default to an assumption that I've always tried to be good. But I'm not sure that's accurate. At my 8th grade graduation, one of our classmates recited a poem describing everyone in our grade as we sat on the brink of moving to high school. "Tim Campbell is good at knowing what's right..." is how I was described in said poem. That made my parents happy. But looking back, I feel puzzled. Everyone at this school had only known me for 1.5 years up to that point, and my experience/behavior between 5th and 7th grade was so bad I had to endure the middle school equivalent of being relocated on assignment to an outpost in Siberia. Hardly a ringing endorsement of someone who "knows what's right". The memories I have of this time are almost all from 5th _or_ 8th grade. Changing schools from 5th to 6th, and then again halfway through 7th, means the interim year and a half is a blur. The 7th grade switch marked a turning point and I think even I realized something had to change. I didn't want to be getting in trouble all the time. And despite my (promise to myself to be honest)[essay link], I'd slipped into a retched streak of dishonesty in an attempt to mitigate my constant punishments. I think I took the 7th grade swap as a sign that things needed to improve or else, so I was already in a good frame of mind when we up and moved again the following year.

The move in the summer before high school was a gleaming contrast to our other move. It was a sigh of relief, a clean slate, and some much needed closure of that chapter in our lives. Maybe I was just getting older and maturity was taking over, but I wanted (most of) my choices to have defensible outcomes for once. I still did dumbass things, like getting caught driving my friend home before I had my license. He lived less than half a mile away. My parents were away with my sister in Boston. Until they pulled into the street behind me as I pulled out of the driveway. I didn't even think to look in the rearview to see them tailing me the entire way.

Occasional blips aside, I eventually came around and left all the nonsense behind. But that makes me wonder...was avoiding getting into deep, irreconcilable, department-of-corrections trouble the result of sheer luck, or would my natural proclivities always come into play and steer me back onto the road before I ended up aflame in the ditch? When does a fortunate bounce lead to "phew, never again!" instead of "I didn't get caught, let's ride this train to glory!" As a parent, it terrifies me to think that no matter what I say or what example I set, my childrens natures will ultimately dictate whether or not they stay on an upward path. I've seen how identical upbringings can produce polarized outcomes. All I can do is cross my fingers no one gets into _too much_ trouble.




Notes for next time: Talk about how correlation is so easily misdirected? Or have you beat that dead horse enough? Otherwise, start talking about big changes in 5th grade.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
