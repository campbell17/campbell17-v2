I've lived in this house for three years, and I'm still learning about it. One of our showers has leaky handles. It's an old walk-in the size of a phone booth for anorexics, and has equally old handles and stems. I went through my whole life ignorant to the inner workings of old shower faucets. But that all changed when the leaking got worse. Now I know what a packing nut is. When faced with the prospect of fixing something like this, timing plays a big part. Had we just moved in, I'd have dozens of other concerns saturating my attention and I wouldn't have the bandwidth needed to even consider fixing it myself.

But we're well established now. The high priority projects are behind us and we have some nice-to-haves underway, but those aren't urgent. These are suitable conditions to plunge into the unknown and volunteer for the inevitable pain of fumbling through fixing something we haven't the faintest clue about.

I could rattle through paragraphs about my approach to tackling opaque domestic problems like this, but it's the opacity itself I find intriguing. When we descend upon a new habitat, our circle of familiarity is tiny. I know where the doors are, that's good. At least I can get in and out of the place, so I got that going for me. Which is nice. I know what _some_ of the light switches do, that's good. At least I can make my way around in the dark without impaling myself on the furniture. So I got that going for me...

Need to plug something in? That's going to take an FBI-level investigation during which my face will be pressed against the wall no fewer than 10 times to look behind all the drawers, desks, and davenports we've heaved in front of the outlets. Each time a domestic need arises, I'm starting from zero and have to undertake a miniature research project to expand my circle of familiarity. 

But I secretly love it. 

A big part of the excitement of a new place for me is getting the lay of the land and making mental notes of as much as I can so I can be somewhat useful when called upon to flex that inside knowledge. And it's not limited to the house itself. I remember the first time I mowed the lawn. We have a little over an acre and at the time I only had a push mower - we had a micro lawn at the old house - but I didn't mind because I took pleasure in getting acquainted with the unknown bounds of our property. For the record, _not minding_ was short lived. Push mowers, especially those without power assist, are the devil.

It's worth noting this is a habit I didn't form until I migrated from apartment living to owning a home, though I suspect there's some personal growth mixed in. It's hard to tell if I'd be just as curious learning about the intricacies of my plumbing if someone else, i.e. a landlord, was on the hook to fix it. Maybe if he was a deadbeat I'd have no choice...

Even so, what I've found is my circle of familiarity is directly connected to how much my place feels like home. This plumbing leak is one of dozens of little issues discovered, learned about, overcome, and stashed away as an entry in my personal codex of this house. As my knowledge expands outward and the size my circle grows, the depth of my roots also increases and fortifies my affinity.

So the next time you encounter the unexpected and feel compelled to call in a professional, take a minute to go on YouTube and see just how many people have solved the same problem. You might surprise yourself and in the process, grow a little closer to the place you called home. Unless it's in the crawlspace. It took me two years to go in there and after what I saw, I'm in no rush to know any more.




I remember the first time I mowed the lawn back in 2021. I have about an acre and a quarter, and at the time I had a push mower suitable for the only for the postage stamp lots you find in most central Florida suburbs. 

Outline: 
- Getting a feel for the bounds of the yard and the subsequent opacity that removed.
- How the circle of familiarity grows over time.
- How that circle relates to the feeling of home (the less I know about my domicile, the more it feels like someone else's. Like a hotel.)
- Lighting the basement
- Entering the crawlspace, the last frontier
- The propspect of "I don't wanna know"
- Thinking back to when we first moved and the garage was still full of stuff
- Anything relevant about the old house?

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.
