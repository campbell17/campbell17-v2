I wrote this in Roam, here's the output:

- On my way from my car to the elevator in the airport parking garage, I noticed a someone's beautiful volvo still had its headlights on. I stopped walking. Did this person just arrive, and the lights would shut off automatically in a few minutes? I considered that. But then I considered the alternative, that they left them on. As I stood there, I pictured someone returning from a short trip or a long wait for a loved one's arrival to a dead battery and a bad time. The car's probably locked anyway. And what lunatic would open a stranger's car door and molest their light stalk? My kind, apparently. 
- This happened yesterday and as I make these notes so I can write about this later, which is now, my actions, which I believed to be noble, right, justified, and brave at the time, are ever so slightly tempered with the stink of the following realities, which until this point had not crossed my mind:
- 1. I could have checked the hood for the latent heat that would confirm my suspicion about the recency of Volvo owner's arrival.
- 2. I was in the short-term parking garage, which would speak to a picker-upper as opposed to a traveler going on a trip long enough to drain the battery dead upon their return.
- 3. Modern cars, and this beautiful example of a Volvo wagon was off-the-lot smelly of new car, so as never to be mistaken for anything but modern, at least for the next half-decade or so, always have a loud and annoying (by design) chime that sounds when you open the door with the lights on full-on-drain-my-battery-mode to let you know you've left the lights on full-on-drain-my-battery-mode and that you opening the door signifies that you most likely forgot that you left the lights on full-on-drain-my-battery-mode and are now attempting to erroneously depart without taking the proper do-not-drain-my-battery precautions. 
- In the light of this new evidence vis-à-vis the probability that the lights of this fresh, beautiful, and positively modern Volvo being left on would likely __not__ cause the owner and fellow family members or affluent probably-horse-farm-owning close friends being picked up from the Philadelphia International Airport any duress at all, and in reality might afford them diminished visibility in the heavy squall they found themselves in on the way home to the horse farm since they would have no way of knowing someone had well-meaningly but somewhat unlawfully breached their car's fortress and turned OFF the automatic safety lighting system Volvo spent $764,000 developing, I have come to the conclusion that I am not the hero of this story, but the villain.
- Lock your doors, people.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
