The year is 2010 and I'm watching an episode of "Louie" on FX back when I still had cable (note: "back when..." something more interesting). The episode concludes without incident and though I enjoy it, I move on to other 2010-ey things and don't think much more about it. (note: this needs more setup, but I'm moving on for now to try to get my point in writing. Maybe don't describe the scene in too much detail, lest those who've seen it will guess the surprise?) ...something something something and a phrase is uttered that has been haunting me ever since. (save the phrase as the surprise) 

I think about this phrase at least a dozen times a year. This phrase is the antidote to the contrarian in me. It teaches me how to grow up. It stands confident and forthright at the threshold between innocence and experience. Between amateur and professional. Between child and adult. This phrase holds the answer to so many existential questions. (note: see if this can be drawn out without making it tiresome. Moving on for now)

(note: do I reveal it now or keep waiting?)

(note: found the transcript:

Hey, hey, I'm really sorry about how it's going.
That's ok, that's ok. So what is it, are you nervous?
Not really.
What then?
I just don't like acting. I'm not good at it and I don't like it.
Look...look maybe you don't like acting. That's not my business. But try and respect other people's work. We're gonna move on and then we'll come back and shoot your scene. And why don't you take a walk and try to find it in yourself to give a shit?)

"...try to find it in yourself to give a shit."

Witnessing this final desperate recommendation caused a nuke to detonate (note: figure out how to smooth this out) [in my perception of reality.] For decades up to this point, I thought I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to do. And if circumstances forced me, I could just coast until it was over and move on. Now, usually coasting is possible, but there's a hidden cost. A wraith born out of dodged responsibilities begins to shadow you and it grows in strength and audibility (note: look for a more accessible word for "loudness") each time you fail to act our your best self.

for next time: more about "shirk your responsibilities at your peril". Gretszky, Jordan, Dimaggio - people pay to come see you, you can't afford to underperform.



Original opening: 
Years ago while watching a show, a particular scene caught my attention. 



What is the surprise of this story?
