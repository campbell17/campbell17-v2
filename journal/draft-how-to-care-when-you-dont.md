The year is 2010 and I'm watching an episode of "Louie" on FX back when I still had cable (note: "back when..." something more interesting). note: add some meat before this - you go right to a 'conclusion' with not enough context: The episode concludes without incident and though I enjoy it, I move on to other 2010-ey things and don't think much more about it. (note: this needs more setup, but I'm moving on for now to try to get my point in writing. Maybe don't describe the scene in too much detail, lest those who've seen it will guess the surprise?) ...something something something and a phrase is uttered that has been haunting me ever since. (save the phrase as the surprise) 

I think about this phrase at least a dozen times a year. This phrase is the antidote to the contrarian in me. It teaches me how to grow up. It stands confident and forthright at the threshold between innocence and experience. Between amateur and professional. Between child and adult. This phrase holds the answer to so many existential questions. (note: see if this can be drawn out without making it tiresome. Moving on for now)

(note: do I reveal it now or keep waiting?)

(note: found the transcript:

Hey, hey, I'm really sorry about how it's going.
That's ok, that's ok. So what is it, are you nervous?
Not really.
What then?
I just don't like acting. I'm not good at it and I don't like it.
Look...look maybe you don't like acting. That's not my business. But try and respect other people's work. We're gonna move on and then we'll come back and shoot your scene. And why don't you take a walk and try to find it in yourself to give a shit?)

"...try and respect other people's work...try to find it in yourself to give a shit." note: keep the whole thing or just the end?

Witnessing this final desperate recommendation caused a nuke to detonate (note: figure out how to smooth this out) [in my perception of reality.] For decades up to this point, I thought I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to do. And if circumstances forced me, I could just coast until it was over and move on.

But there's a problem with coasting. Coasting is costly.

Maybe not right away. Certainly not consciously. But if you make a habit of it, something emerges.

Your own personal wraith born out of dodged responsibilities and underutilized potential begins to shadow you, growing in power and presence each time you fail to do the right thing. With every missed opportunity to Do The Workâ„¢, the wraith acquires another merit badge at your expense, ultimately gaining all the power and leaving you with nothing but anxiety and regret.

And that's just the individual cost. We could populate an armada with the amount of people downstream whose lives would benefit just a little if we could only get our act together. And that's the key puzzle piece I could never quite find in the box: there are people _other than myself_ that I'm cheating out of a successful outcome.

You hear stories about sports legends who have to learn at some point that dogging it even for one moment during the game is unforgivable when fans paid money to come see them. (note: find quotes from all three below to put here about learning that)

The concept that other people are trying their best eluded me... note: I'm trying to get across that it never dawned on me that my immaturity/unprofessionalism affects others. "Hell, I didn't even know I was unprofessional yet." - something about that?

for next time: (still) more about "shirk your responsibilities at your peril". Gretszky, Jordan, Dimaggio - people pay to come see you, you can't afford to underperform.



Original opening: 
Years ago while watching a show, a particular scene caught my attention. 



What is the surprise of this story?
