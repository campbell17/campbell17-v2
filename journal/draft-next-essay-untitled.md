I'm entering dangerous territory. I'm noticing things. When you notice things-if you have any sense-you feel compelled to do something about them. I enjoy reading books and writing thoughts. In all my years on this good earth, the particulars of those hobbies acted like two ships passing in the night. A few nights ago while doing some bedtime reading, all that changed.

At first I felt charmed by my little discovery. Oh, isn't that interesting, I thought. But I moved on, not yet realizing I was about to know my true nakedness. Then last night, it happened again. Now, it's settled. I'm hosed. Hoopajooped. Hopeless.

As recently as last week, when I read a book I submitted my attention to subject of the writing. _What_ is the author showing me? A straightforward reading policy. Now, however, I'm just as interesting in _how_ the author shows me. Have I just simultaneously ruined two hobbies? I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, but only now in the context of writing every day do I see how that "noticing" applies to me. I can't unsee that. I see clear as day the cavernous canyon between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading. So now what? Do I continue to wallow in the sewers where my current skills reside? Or do I take on this new suffering and bear it, embarking on a journey out of the darkness?

The former. The end. Thanks for reading!

If only that was possible.

It reminds me of playing an open-world game for the first time. You go through the tutorial to learn a bit of gameplay, then you unlock the world map. Sometimes, depending on the game, you're limited just a piece of the map, but you don't know it yet. You think, "wow, that's a lot of ground to cover." Then, let's say a few missions in, you unlock the rest of the map. This moment - the instant your brain processes that you just lost your innocence - immediately places you at a fork in the road. "This is too much. I already thought the world was too big, and this is immeasurably bigger. I can't do this. But...I really want to." This isn't the first time I've had epiphanies like this, but usually they're in a passive context where I'm nowhere near the subject matter and have no plans to be.

Note for next time: pick up the trail on this latest paragraph. Introduce some notes about the zone of suck from AvE's learning curve explanation. 

Note: the point is as follows - For the first time, I'm not only considering the subject matter of the writing, but the manner in which it is written. I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, but only now in the context of writing every day do I see how that "noticing" applies to me. I can't unsee that. I see clear as day the cavernous canyon between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading. Now what? Do I continue to wallow in the sewers where my current skills reside? Or do I take on this new suffering and bear it, embarking on a journey out of the darkness?

Note for visual aids / metaphor: this discovery is similar to the worldmap in an open-world game. You enter knowing almost nothing, and you think "wow that's a big area to cover" when you see the map. Then you complete a few missions and the rest of the map opens and now the veil is lifted. Now you can see with your own eyes that you didn't know anything. And who's to say that won't happen again in exactly the same way once you complete THAT map. Spoiler alert. It will. Other examples include Clickspring for detail-oriented precision machining, Frank howarth for process filmmaking, woodworking, etc. Kim Jung Gi for ink drawing. Mike Dawes for fingerstyle guitar. Paradigm-shifting discoveries. Oh THIS IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE??? (Stuff on computer desk flipping meme - flip, flip, flip, flip, throws hands up)
