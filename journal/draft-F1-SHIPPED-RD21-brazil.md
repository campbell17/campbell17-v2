22 laps to go. 3.5 seconds is the gap. Perez is six tenths quicker. Then another four tenths. Then back up to six tenths. And on it goes, until the gap vanishes completely. In a vastly superior Red Bull machine, Sergio Perez cozies up to the gearbox of Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin a mere 4 laps into their final stint. After three more laps hovering just outside the 1-second interval required to use DRS, Sergio puts a clean lap together to knock four tenths off the gap and opens his rear wing as they head onto the main straight. On paper, the move is already done and Perez pulls a comfortable gap away from Alonso by the end of the next lap. But races aren't run on paper. And Perez is about to soak in a first-hand retelling of the bed time story Alonso read to Michael Schumacher back in 2005, six years before Sergio even began his F1 career.

I didn't have a favorite driver in F1 until Juan Pablo Montoya left Chip Ganassi Racing in America for a Williams drive in 2001. He didn't exactly fit the mold when he broke into the sport. He didn't play politics and he didn't roll over for the encumbant royalty. After two DNFs to start his F1 career, Montoya stamped his arrival with a breathtaking turn-one overtake in Brazil, hip-checking World Champion Michael Schumacher into the grass before disappearing into the distance. Unfortunately, he couldn't secure the win. When attempting to overtake the lapped can of Jos Verstappen into turn 4, Montoya surprised him by cutting back in front of Verstappen's Arrows just before the braking zone, causing him to lock up and ride up the back of Montoya's race-leading Williams. This brutal disappointment loosely mirrored the trajectory of Montoya's time in F1. Though he showed competitive pace and secured seven race victories in his time, Montoya never seemed comfortable with the culture in the F1 paddock and left the sport in 2006. One year prior, however, another driver from the rookie class that included Montoya caught my attention.

In 2005, Fernando Alonso was entering his fourth season at Renault. After three podiums to start the season including two victories, the teams arrived at Imola for the San Marino grand prix. Alonso's sparring partner, as it was in 2001 for Montoya, was Michael Schumacher. With 13 laps to go, Schumacher made his final pit stop and rejoined two seconds behind. For the next 18 minutes, the most decorated F1 driver in history relentlessly hounded Alonso around the 3 mile circuit in a faster car with fresher tires. And for the next 18 minutes, Fernando Alonso placed his car inch-perfect, apex after apex, corner after corner, lap after lap. When the lap count ticked down to zero, I slid back in my seat and rested, ruminating on the grittiest defense I'd ever seen. A new favorite driver emerged.

Eighteen years later, at the 2023 Brazilian grand prix, Fernando Alonso would be forgiven for conceding third place under the intense pressure from Sergio Perez. The Red Bull is a faster car. The Red Bull has fresher tires. And when Sergio dives down the inside into turn 1 on the penultimate lap, we all understand how he'll pull away and build enough gap to hold onto the final podium position. On paper, we all understand this. But races aren't run on paper. And with the same level of hunger and grit he had at 23, Alonso stays with Perez. He keeps his car close. He waits for the right moment. And on the final lap, heading into turn 4 where Montoya's race came to an end in 2001, Fernando took back third place and claimed his 106th podium.



This is extemporaneous: After entering the sport with Minardi in 2001, he left the grid the following year to join Renault as their test driver at the recommendation of his manager. After a season of working with the engineers to improve the cars of Giancarlo Fisichella and Jensen Button, Alonso got a race seat in 2003. The preparation year clearly paid off as Alonso set records for youngest pole sitter and race winner. 

- Alonso holding off Perez for lap after lap after the final round of pitstops with strategic recharging and clever lines in the infield and onto the front straight. Same performance as the defense against Schumacher at Imola in 2005.

- My favorite driver of all time is Juan Pablo Montoya. He didn't exactly fit the mold when he broke into F1. He didn't play the game. He didn't know his place. He didn't roll over for the Royalty at the time, Michael Schumacher. He broke into the sport in 2001 and he had my full attention. I watched him light up the win column in America for two seasons prior to joining F1 so naturally he was the one I followed. But the year before he left F1, another driver who joined in 2001, albeit more quietly, caught my attention and planted the seed that would blossom into taking the mantle of favorite driver upon Montoya's departure. Just like Montoya did in 2001, Alonso did not roll over for Schumacher and held off relentless pursuit for the final ___ laps of the San Marino grand prix at imola. This weekend in Brazil, where Montoya got his elbows out against Schumacher, Alonso captured his 107th podium with an electric defense against a Sergio Perez in the superior Red Bull.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
