How this site came together
It began with a choice: update my stale personal site or build something new. 

My gut told me to build something new. "Show you can ship", my gut told me. I drafted a few bullet points, notes, and ideas. Then the timid side of me peeked over my shoulder and added his own: "Do none of these, just update your site, stupid."

I let a day pass. I slept on it. Looking over my notes the next day, it occurred to me there's no such thing as "just an update". My personal site was full of signs of neglect after nearly 15 years of steady employment at the same company. I knew if I attempted an update I would spend too much time trying to resolve existing wounds whether they related to the core outcome or not.

And the core outcome was this: build something simple, interactive, and visually appealing that represented who I was, what I could do, and why I was applying. This set the foundation for every decision thereafter. Having this foundation was crucial in deciding what was a :check: must-have vs. a :empty-check: ~nice-to-have.

Another critical element was to add a time constraint. I allowed myself 4 days to get the core shipped. This meant whatever it was had to be possible for _me_ (not some hero version of me), and it had to be something I'd be proud enough to send directly to the founders. If I winced when I clicked "send" on the LinkedIn DM, that would be a sign of failure.

This also meant I did no design mockups. I knew this was a build-to-know project. With the constraints of my idea in place, I had a general notion of what the mechanics could be. A precise design mockup was not only unnecessary, it would actively derail me. I knew I'd end up trying to match the padding values in the mockup instead of pushing the core forward toward a shippable state.

All I had to go on at the start was this mini fridge whiteboard idea:

I treated this as a loose guide to get me started knowing many or all of its pieces could be replaced as I found more compelling ways to address the core purpose.

I knew I wanted large tiles to be the entry point to the content:


Changelog?

Additions since launch?

Main Beats
Culture

Writing

Attention

Design/The Web


Priority one was to add a constraint. I allowed myself 4 days. The goal was multi-facted. This makes updating my existing site all but a non-starter. I knew if I attempted an update, I would spend too much time trying to resolve existing wounds whether they related to core outcome or not. A time-limited fresh start limits the boondoggles.





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
