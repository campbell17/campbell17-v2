Wins Above Replacement

You're in a booth at a restaurant. Across from you are two familiar faces. On the left, you see yourself from one year ago. On the right, you from this time next year. How different are these people?

Let's make it easier. Instead of one year, let's do five years. Five years ago, and five years from now. Who's across that table?

When we're young, every year is a tremendous jump in development. But every year we age, the value of one year as it pertains to the total percentage of our lifetime decreases. From age 87 to 88, it takes a microscope to detect any difference. But from birth to 1 year old, it's as if we're a different species. In childhood, the changes are physical, and coincide with the growth of our bodies and brains. As adults, what does growth look like?

That depends on what's important to us. That depends on the delta between what we are and what we wish we were. That depends on whether or not we're paying attention to ourselves.

For the amount of time I spend thinking about stuff like this, it strikes me as odd I don't talk about this with any friends. "If you could only pick one thing, what's something you would improve about yourself this year?" What sort of answers might we get? 

"A new job."

"Travel more."

"Spend more time with my kids."

"Exercise and eat better." Probably a ton of these.

"&shrug;"

I bet a lot of the answers would center around things people want to do, as opposed to traits they wish were different. "To be a better listener", for example, is probably not very high on the list.

While it's possibly unhealthy to ruminate on the abundance of dead wood in our personalities in the form of bad habits, vices, grudges, and mistakes, taking a look in the attic once in a while might lead to some big leaps in quality of life.

There's a small fly in the ointment, though, from the realm of the unknown unknowns. As a matter of course, we're constantly improving. It's in our nature as humans to push beyond our current state. The vibrations of our exploratory instincts produces a steady hum of upward mobility and it's only via tragic missteps we end up in the alternate state of arrested development. So when asked what one thing we might improve, we're probably already working on everything we know to work on, or at least have it listed as a ticket in the backlog.

These blindspots are as fundamental as the will to improve them, which likely accounts for another primal trait: our need for socialization. My parents, for instance, had to deliver the sad news to me in preschool that I'm not supposed to pick my nose. If they didn't tell me, you bet your ass someone else would before I got too much older. It takes a village.

So maybe I'm asking the wrong question. Maybe instead of asking what someone would improve about themselves, I should be asking what would you improve about _me_. But that sounds like a trick question from your crazy ex who liked to play mind games. Because who but the most neurotic, mal-adjusted psychopath would want to know what their friends really think of them? Simply picturing being asked that question by a friend makes me feel uncomfortable. I would probably dodge it with something like, "You're fine. If you think you're being an asshole, just wait five minutes. Someone will tell you."

Or will they?

I was told at work once I was "difficult". It took nearly a decade working with the same people for this to be brought to my attention (after years of glowing performance reviews, no less). Thanks a pantload, guys.

There's a statistic in baseball called (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement)[Wins Above Replacement], or "WAR" for short. It's used to calculate how valuable a player is compared to what the average player would achieve in their place. Uber-nerds may argue over the details of its effacacy, but I think the gist supplies a sound concept to address the subject of personal improvement. Maybe it's not about changing the one thing. Instead, as we sit across the table from our past and future selves, maybe all we need to do is ask ourselves a simpler question. How many wins did I get compared to my past self, and how many wins did my future self get compared to me? As long as we keep the needle pointing in the right direction over a long enough time, the improvement will manifest itself.

Using WAR like this helps separate us from some of the irrational urgency that can cripple our psyche in weak moments. I don't subscribe to platitudes like "you're doing enough" because I know in my heart I'm a lazy POS. But by at least abstracting the scrutiny into a core metric, we can see the change from a high level over time without tying ourselves into knots over every last detail. Maybe next year I'll finally get around to kicking the habit of picking my nose.


As with everything, it starts with incentives. To care enough in the first place, we need a forcing function to shove the idea of improvement to the front of our minds. Discontent, depression, restlessness, and wanderlust are just a few of the signs of imbalance. 

<!-- I don't think this fits the rest: -->
<!-- But to each their own. Some of the happiest, most successful people are simply too dumb to question themselves while some of the most brilliant are often too smart for their own good. All we can do is strive to be brilliant enough to have good ideas and dumb enough not to ask too many questions.  -->


For the steamrollers of the world, the ones pioneering, innovating, and hyper-driven in the animalistic sense, looking back is unnatural. <!-- is this a subject (personality types) worth adding to this? -->

Let's make some notes:
- How do we spend our time?
- What things do we spend time on we wish we didn't?
- What would we do instead?
- Would we actually do that, or just fill that time with bullshit?
- How to prevent doing that.
- The tension between a tranquil life and that of constant self-inflicted obligation.
  - If I've done nothing but rid myself of extranneous responsibilities, how can I tell which ones will add to my WAR and which will end up becoming the things I wish I didn't spend time on?
    - Make To Know, probably. Meaning, you can't know. You have to do them all before you can tell. Damn.
  - Certain personality types render this question moot - Steamrollers, a.k.a. pioneers, innovators, hyper-driven in the animalistic sense, won't ever stop long enough for questioning. It's self-evident that their time is being spent without their conscious participation.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
