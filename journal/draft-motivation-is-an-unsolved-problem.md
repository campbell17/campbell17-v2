There's a pattern of behavior that causes people to try very hard, with earnest intention and intense motivation, and just when they get pretty good at whatever they're trying, they stop improving. The resistance that comes along with the final 20% of improvement is so thick that it is far more comfortable to tread water at 80% (or even 60%) than grab for that next gear and grind their way into excellence.

I'm a huge proponent of "good enough". My entire life is so saturated with _good enough_, I'm considering commissioning a half-finished statue with no upper body adorned with that phrase on the placard. Of course, people have varying standards of what constitutes a passable level of aptitude. For instance, I wouldn't want my heart surgeon to subscribe to my good enough lifestyle, but it works just fine for a golfing buddy. There are some aspects of my circle of competence, though, where good enough just isn't.

I'm currently in the throes of trying to get to the next tier of skill with my art. When I say art, I only mean drawing, painting, or some combination of the two. I understand that design and photography are part of the arts, but in my brain they occupy a different category. To me, those are like "solved" math problems. If you showed me a photograph or a piece of design, I could confidently claim to be able to achieve something close in quality. With my art, I'm still searching for that repeatable process that produces a desireable result most of the time. I would compare it to the scientific method and I haven't put enough work in to reach that good enough level.
