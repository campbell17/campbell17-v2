I don't love it.

Dirty Jobs. Remember that show? I know Discovery recently revived it, but I haven't seen the new ones, so to me it still feels cancelled. The format remains unchanged as host Mike Rowe treks across America meeting people from all walks of life who all have one thing in common: their work is filthy. Hence the name of the show. The premise focuses heavily on the necessary, indespensible nature of the work and the fact that despite its repugnance, these intrepid souls soldier on every day. They're the "someones" in "it's a dirty job, but _someone's_ gotta do it".

But being a dyed-in-the-wool champion for the (value of the trades)[mikeroweworks.com], Rowe often dedicates a short soliloquy to spotlight an easily overlooked aspect of the happy lives these dirty jobbers cultivate. They do not _love_ what they do. Or at least they didn't when they first embarked on their begrimed journey. These roadkill scoopers[1], pig farmers[2], worm grunters[3], and diaper cleaners[4] were not following their passions to fame and glory, but they're enjoying financialy stability and a sincere sense of purpose nonetheless.

But I wonder if these people ever stare out the window while sipping their Sunday coffee and daydream about passions left unchased.

Perhaps not, though. Perhaps they didn't have anything else they really loved. Or even liked. Maybe they're awash in the relief that they at least found even one thing they can do well. Or maybe, like me, they liked _too many_ things without truly loving _one_.

It's hard to make steep progress when your interests vary wildly, a disease of which I've always been afflicted. I like all kinds of stuff, and I get very interested in certain hobbies. But I never get _obsessed_. And I have a nagging fear that obsession is necessary.

Because obsessions are like rockets. Purpose-built. They focus on one thing and even the slightest deviation causes what rocket scientists playfully refer to as "massive unplanned disassembly". Trying to make progress with many interests is like trying to climb a mountain where all trails lead halfway back down before ascending again.

Fortunately it's not all for nothing since there's merit in the cross-discipline expansion of skills. New interests often have a habit of bolstering others. But while I'll admit that my plethora of interests couples well with my (good enough)[goodenoughessay.com] philosophy, when it comes to getting to the moon, being obsessive is the only way to fly.

And yet not everyone is built like the Saturn V. Though I believe people can change, those changes are usually limited to habits, choices, and lifestyle. So while part of me would love nothing more than to get insanely proficient at one thing and leave everything else behind, my nature pronounces that prospect DOA.

So I'm left to hang my hat on the romantic idea that tradeoffs remain undefeated, and the people I idolize for reaching the top of their particular mountain had to sacrifice everything else to get there. I saw a video recently that documented NHL stars hand delivering tickets to the season ticket holders. One nice old lady baked cookies for Sidney Crosby. He was right in the middle of preseason training, so his nutrition regimen meant he had to politely decline. What a shame.

Me and those people on Dirty Jobs? We get to eat cookies.




<!-- This might be useful in a longer essay, but a shorter mention of tradeoffs may be more appropriate here. -->
- Something I didn't expect about getting older is my growing intuition regarding tradeoffs. When I was younger, I still maintained the naive belief that the concept of free was real. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
