I've sacrificed an untold number of opportunities at the altar of comfort. I have an urge in my bones to quit while I'm ahead. To stop just when things might get wild. When they might get interesting. Because interesting usually means unbridled. And that's one of the cornerstones of being interesting: unpredictability. 

I've always behaved as if I believe going too far in one direction will close off all others. In a way, this is true. If I spend thousands of hours learning the piano so I can play Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, I'm unlikely to have enough time to learn how to play Petrucci's guitar solo from Under a Glass Moon. Fine. The problem is, now I can't play either. Instead of playing either piano or guitar exceptionally, I can play Chopsticks and the intro to Nothing Else Matters.

This mentality isn't limited to learning things, either. I don't like the idea of traveling. I say "idea" of traveling because every time I travel, I have a great time. Even when things go sideways, they make for funny stories and lasting memories (comedy = tragedy + time). But whenever my wife broaches the subject of traveling, my stomach drops and I feel compelled to drop a flashbang under the table and dive out the door so I don't have to talk about it.

I don't like cruises. My ideal vacation is a lake house with no activities scheduled. That doesn't mean I want to do nothing the whole time, though there will be plenty of that also, it just means we wake up, assess how we feel, look at what's around, and go do something if we want. By contrast, on a cruise you have excursions, tours, breakfast times, dinner times, theme nights, formal nights, plans, plans, plans. Everything is scheduled to within an inch of its life. I don't like cruises. Except that's not true. I don't like the _idea_ of cruises. At the time of this writing, I've been on...let's see...

...12, going on 13 cruises (we have one in 2 weeks). And there's a non-zero chance I forgot a few. There's a caveat, however. My wife works in the cruise industry, so many of these were either work-related or otherwise discounted down to costing almost nothing. Still, one might argue that just because a jab to the ribs doesn't cost anything doesn't mean I want a baker's dozen.

But that's the part that doesn't make any sense. None of these trips were punches to the ribs. They were all fun, exciting, and memorable. So why does the _idea_ of going on one always fill me with dread?

We just got back from spending 17 days in Italy, hence my three week writing hiatus. We had that trip planned 2 years in advance and I got anxiety every time anyone brought it up. I was such a baby about it, I didn't want to be involved in any decisions about the itinerary. "This is your trip, I'm just showin' up." Last night I was telling one of my friends about all the incredible, delicious, breathtaking, and hilarious things we got to see, do, eat, and experience while we were traipsing all over the country. I could feel how energized I was while reliving some of the memories we just made. And this has been true my whole life. "Don't wanna do it, don't wanna do it, don't wanna do it, you can't make me, OMG I'm so glad I did it."

The other day I heard something that resonated with me in a way that shows just how weak my stance on doing stuff is: the most interesting people are interested people. When I picture myself getting enthusiastic about something, I like what I see. When I picture myself as the sad sac buzzkill I've subjected my loved ones to my whole life, I feel a visceral hatred for that person. That guy sucks ass. So the next time someone floats the idea of doing something out of my comfort zone, I'm going to drag myself kicking and screaming into life and be all about it.



I hate to travel, but I do it all the time. I hate cruises, but I've been on dozens. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
