- {{[[TODO]]}} Wanting to do things, then doing them vs. wanting to do things, then NOT doing them
    - When does something I want to do get put into the category of something I'm doing?
        - I wanted to use Roam better than I am and I knew I would tend to that, but today is the day I don't want to wait another day to start on it. Why is __today__ that day?
