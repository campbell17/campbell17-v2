I want to talk about domestic agency. 

Domestic, in this case, means your physical domain. Where you live. Your castle. Your cave. Your dwelling. Your domicile. But not just the insidey parts. Because to truly master your domain, you also need to come to grips with outer bounds of your dominion. Your personal compound. Your area of rule.

- This is more about mastery. Asserting dominance over your ft² of sovereignty.
- While eating lunch over the weekend, I gazed through the window to my back yard and the power & data lines connecting my house to the main run. _My_ lines. Ok, I pay the power company to use them and I'm technically renting them, but nerts to that, they're mine. Everything is mine. You know why? Because when something is mine, it becomes my responsibility to fix what's wrong with it.
- I do this not because I'm in love with being on the hook for every tiny thing that needs maintenance, though that's part of it (it's nice to feel needed). I do this because it sidesteps days or even weeks of waiting for someone else to deal with my problem. And by the way, who should I call? That question in itself is often a boondoggle and I can usually fix most problems in the time it takes to get that part alone squared away. I'll give you an example.
- Last week my nightly routine of wasting my life away by watching sports was interrupted by a loud crunching sound from outside. I live amongst the trees and their indifference comes down in the form of branches pelting my house and yard. Based on the origin of the sound, I deduced that a branch fell on part of the roof just behind where I was sitting. I put on some shoes and stepped outside to corroborate my assumption. The sound, as it turned out, came from the mast that holds the run of power and data lines from the main pole behind my back yard. But the branch was not on the roof, nor was it on the ground near the roof. It was laying over the power lines halfway between my house and the pole. The lines are low, so they have mounting brackets attached to a tree about 15 feet up from where the branch came down. There's no way to know, but I think the sound came from the impact of the branch breaking the lines off their mounting brackets and the subsequent whiplash crashing into the mast on the house. Either way I was floored the lights didn't flicker since mine is the kind of power that quivers when someone sneezes too hard.
- To complicate matters, I have a quadrangle of string lights above the fire pit in that same area. By coincidence, the day prior, one of those strings came down on its own so it was already on the ground and not subjected to the force of the branch. Two of the four strings remained alight so I could at least see what I was doing while I brought the mini chainsaw to bear on the ends of the branches caught up in the power line.
- First, I had to test if the line was live with the brilliant strategy of slapping the edge of the main branch like Joe Pesci testing the hot doorknob in Home Alone. I didn't die, so I was ready to proceed. Safety Third™.
- What followed was a series of semi-strategic cuts to simultaneously free the line from the branch ends while not giving myself a concussion in the process. The saving grace of this entire situation was the fact that the majority of the weight of the branch was already on the ground and leaning against its mother, the tremendous oak tree holding up one corner of the lights. Based on my forensic analysis of the impact area and the lights still being on, I inferred the branch fell straight down, pierced the ground at the base of the oak, and then laid itself over the power lines as it came to rest. Had the branch hit the lines directly, the generator would still be running.
- In a matter of minutes, I had the branch dismembered and piled up next to the fire pit in a display of foreshadowing of her ultimate fate. Phase one of the recovery was complete.
- The next day, the wires still hung low across the yard. They're taught enough to stay off the ground on their own, but at some point before we moved here the power company (I assume) screwed a bracket to a hickory tree to lift them so no one gets clotheslined while chasing a frisbee. My next order of business was to reattach them to said bracket.
- I arranged a tall ladder to bring me face to face with the bracket. It's about 12 feet up. The fiberoptic data line is easy as it's lighter and has a simple hook just below the main bracket. The power line is a bundle of two wires and a steel braided guide wire which is badly frayed from all the abuse the trees rained down over the years. I inspected the lines for any such fraying as touching any non-insulated part of those would be the last thing I did on this earth. One more Home Alone test later, and I hoisted the bunch up and affixed them to the bracket via a metal loop they installed for expressly this purpose.
- Good as new. And by new I mean jerry-rigged and I'll 100% be up here again the next time a limb comes down.
- But that's the whole point. It took me a grand total of twenty minutes to cut the line free from its branches and remount it where it belongs. That's domestic agency. 
- When we first got this house, I knew nothing. I had no intel and no experience addressing the routine challenges that come along with living in _this house_. This house is fairly old, built in the late 50's, and I used to believe new builds wouldn't come with all the little issues I've had to learn about over the years. But I don't believe that any more. I think every place we live has as many eccentricities as its occupants, and learning how to deal with those is worth doing. Yes, I could call someone every time something went wrong or needed to be fixed, and at some point maybe I'll get to a place in my life where I'd rather just wait a few days and pay a few hundred to make the problem go away. But I think to earn that right, I need to have fixed everything myself at least once to know whether or not I can pass it off.
- A few days after I fixed the power lines, my wife heard a loud bang when she hit the button to close the garage door. One of the torsion springs failed, so the opener couldn't pull it up any more. Torsion springs are huge, and very dangerous to replace. But I had to do this exact repair in our old house when we didn't have as much money to pay for repairs like this. Back then I found a video on YouTube that I understood clearly, bought the parts I needed, and fix the problem. It was simple, but labor intensive. So when it happened again in this house, I called someone to get pricing before I took it on again. It was more than I wanted to pay. I told them I'd try to fix it myself and that I'd call them back if I changed my mind. They warned me it was dangerous, which was nice, and I assured them I'd done it before and not to worry.
- But after 10 minutes of assessing the extent of the problem, I decided the time was right to sit one out. I called the guy back. He made me a deal, knowing I was hesitant about the cost, and he came that night. It took him a grand total of 35 minutes to do what would have taken me a meaty 4 hours to complete, and he did it better. 
- There are some problems I'll never call someone to fix, but I learned that at least half of that unwillingness stems from my natural curiosity about how things work. In essense, I'm making a bet against the standard response to the unexpected. Instead of calling in an expert, I say "I bet I could figure that out." But once I do fix something, I have my intel and the playing field levels. I get to keep fixing things I don't mind fixing and call in help for the rest. That's the sweet spot. Now excuse me while I search YouTube for "how to bury power lines".





But what I learned about myself in the afterglow of overpaying someone to do my work for me

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
