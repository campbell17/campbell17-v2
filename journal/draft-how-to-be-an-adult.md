How to be an adult.

- Shopping is a necessity, not a hobby.
- Don't take care of it tomorrow. Don't take care of it today. Take care of it right now.
- Figure out how much money you make. Figure out how much money you spend. Remove everything that isn't a bill.
- Entertainment is not a bill. It's a luxury.
- Insurance is not a luxury. It's a bill.
- Cars are for transportation, not status.
- If you want to buy something you don't need, wait a week.
- Make an alarm for it.
- Send birthday cards. Send birthday cards on time.
- Invest. 401k if you're employed by a company. 
- Go to the doctor.
- Don't cancel appointments.
- Leave early so you get there early.
- If it's broken, try to fix it.
- When something goes wrong, find at least one thing you could have done differently to prevent it. 
    If someone else is involved, tell them your things. Do not point out theirs. 
      Example: "I definitely coulc/should have done x when y happened. That might have made this situation better. Period." <--- There's a space here to add a "but, you also could have...". Leave that space empty by promptly shutting up. This takes practice.
- Don't let others catch you on your phone. See also: don't be on your phone. See also: don't have your phone out in general.
- Know that rudeness is a choice. No one else can make you rude.
- Know that getting offended is an emotion but _staying_ offended is a choice. No one else can make you stay offended.
- Know that on rare occasions, feeling offended is the appropriate response.
- Know that activism is not a valid career path. Study civics instead.
- Wave to your neighbors.
- Know that there is such a thing as normal. It's much better than it sounds.
- Know that some days don't belong to you. Your spouse's birthday, for example.
- Have a spouse.
- If you see a piece of trash, pick it up and throw it out.
- Don't tailgate.
- Don't commit crime.
- Make lists.
- Understand there's no such thing as "every time", "always", and "never".

Notes for next time: Write two or three sentences for each.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
