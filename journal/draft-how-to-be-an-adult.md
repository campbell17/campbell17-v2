How to tell if you're an adult.

Generalities
  You're pleasant.
  - You wave to your neighbors whether you know them or not.

  You're self-sufficient.
  - If it's broken, you at least try to fix it.

  You're clean.
  - If you see a piece of trash, pick it up and throw it out.

  You're not unnecessarily unsafe.
  - When driving, you never tailgate.

  You're civilized.
  - You don't commit crime.

Finances
  You don't Shop.
  - You believe shopping is a necessity, not a hobby.

  You're patient.
  - If you want to buy something you need, you wait a week. If you want to buy something you don't need, you wait a month.

  You budget.
  - You calculate how much money you make per month and compare it to what you spend per month. You remove all expenses that aren't bills and save the rest, leaving only a tiny amount reserved for luxuries.
  
  You're financially honest.
  - You understand all forms of entertainment and dining out are not bills. They're luxuries.

  You're prepared.
  - You believe insurance is not a luxury. It's a bill.

  You're humble.
  - You believe cars are for transportation, not status.

  You're future-oriented.
  - You contribute to a 401k (if offered) and/or other retirement funds.

Responsibilities
  You don't procrastinate.
  - You don't take care of it tomorrow. You don't take care of it today. You take care of it right now.

  You remember.
  - When it has to be done at a certain time, you set an alarm for it.

  You're thoughtful.
  - You send birthday cards. And you send birthday cards on time.

  You're healthy.
  - You go to the doctor, dentist, and dermotologist annually. Not just when you're unwell.

  You're reliable.
  - You don't cancel appointments.

  You're prompt.
  - You leave early so you get there early.

  You're organized.
  - You understand how fickle the human brain is, so you make lists.

Relationships
  You're selfless.
  - You know that some days don't belong to you. Your spouse's birthday, for example.

  You're complete.
  - You understand how much better you are when you have a (the term JBP uses for "positive combatant") so you have a spouse.
  
  You're self-aware.
  - When something goes wrong, find at least one thing you could have done differently to prevent it. 
      If someone else is involved, tell them your things. Do not point out theirs. 
        Example: "I definitely coulc/should have done x when y happened. That might have made this situation better. Period." <--- There's a space here to add a "but, you also could have...". Leave that space empty by promptly shutting up. This takes practice.
  
  You're present.
  - Don't let others catch you on your phone. See also: don't be on your phone. See also: don't have your phone out in general.
  
  You're kind.
  - You understant that rudeness is a choice and no one else can make you rude.
  
  You're level-headed.
  - Know that getting offended is an emotion but _staying_ offended is a choice. No one else can make you stay offended.
  
  You're not insensitive.
  - You know that on rare occasions, feeling offended is the appropriate response.


Balance
  You're calm.
  - You understand that there is such a thing as normal, and it's better than it sounds.
  
  You're realistic.
  - You understand there's no such thing as "every time", "always", and "never".


Notes for next time: Make sure all the "you"'s are in place. Proofread, refine, tweak.
<!-- - Know that activism is not a hobby. Truly get involved or stay home. -->


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
