You wouldn't necessarily know it from the team radio conversations. As the drivers all relaxed their right foot, switched modes on the steering wheel, and picked up bits of rubber on the cooldown lap, the radio calls in Qatar almost seemed routine. Almost. One common thread weaved its way through nearly every post-race sitrep: utter exhaustion. With races all over the globe in some stifling climates, sentiments of fatigue in the aftermath of a grand prix are typical. But the onboard footage as the drivers climbed from their cars this weekend reveals something much more unprecidented.

Show collage of images of drivers in distress

A radio call from Logan Sargeant on lap 39 following a big lockup into turn 10 provided a firm indication that the oppressiveness of the conditions were beyond those of even Singapore, Bahrian, or Malaysia

| Logan Sargeant: Uhh, I don't feel well, man.
| Race engineer, Gaetan Jego: So...are you retiring, mate? Are you retiring?...please confirm?
| LS: I don't know!
| GJ: If you're feeling unwell, you're retiring. It's your call buddy.

A few moments of silence pass, then Jego continues:
| GJ: You're the one making the call if you want to retire or not, Logan. There's no shame retiring if you're feeling unwell.
| LS: Yeah I need to stop. I'm stopping
| GJ: Ok, ok, we'll stop. Box box, retiring the car. Gap to Magnussen is good behind, 8 seconds

At the time, I marked this as a problem specific to Logan. Maybe he was battling a prior illness not made public. But after the race, stories emerged from underneath the podium celebration of exacly how dangerous and oppressive the heat was. One by one, the drivers stopped their cars as directed by FIA officials, adjusted the steering wheel to mode P0, and shut off the engine. To be considered fit enough to compete in an F1 race, drivers must undergo a timed extraction test. In full race gear and completely belted in, drivers are required to exit the cockpit in 5 seconds or less. While no one is scrutinized to that standard during race weekends, if an impromptu test were administered in Qatar, zero drivers would pass.

And witnessing the state of some drivers is downright frightening. Alex Albon was in such a weakened state, he couldn't lift his own legs over the side of the cockpit and had to be assisted out. Kevin Magnussen doubled over multiple times beside his car and had to wave team members over with their cooling fans to run air over his face instead of into the radiators of his car. Probably most alarming was Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll, who upon climbing out stumbled toward an emergency vehicle and slammed into the drivers side door, desperately trying to get his helmet and HANS device off. The marshall inside the vehicle took his helmet through the window, then got out to assist Lance around the front of the vehicle. A few moments later, in pictures seen from the onboard camera still running, a mechanic sprints to the car to unhook the dry ice fan and disappears toward the area Lance was headed. Seconds later, other members of the Aston Martin team can be seen abandoning their post-race duties to do the same.

Despite how it may look on television, the fitness level required to drive these cars at competitive speeds for nearly two hours straight is as high or higher than any sport. Seeing these drivers in such distress is an indication to me that the Formula One community dodged one of the biggest bullets of the modern era. In the early days, it was unfashionable to talk about safety. Many saw the sport as gladitorial, and anyone who made waves to make things safer faced savage ridicule. Things aren't like that now. Safety is top priority. But when I look back on Qatar, I can't avoid picturing scenarios of drivers losing consciousness at the worst possible moment and leaving the track while still at full throttle. The cars are safer than ever. The tracks are safer than ever. The medical facilities and procedures are some of the best in the world. But Sunday proved there will always be new risks to overcome. And the sport we all love is lucky no one had to trade their lives to learn this latest lesson.




Notes:

In-lap team radio + driver countenance upon turning the engine off in the pitlane:

Max: Well done, Max. M: Yeah, good win. was a bit close for comfort I think, that last stint, but pace was OK. Another win. Unbelieveable.
Oscar: Alright Oscar. Great job mate, keeping the podium streak going. O: Wowwee, thanks guys, that was probably the heardest race I've ver had in my life.
Lando: P3 mate, p3 great job. L: Yeah welldone boys. Is that 3 in a row now? Well done.

I was tempted to write about track limits this week. Then, poor Logan Sargeant had to retire from the race with what turned out to be extreme dehydration. I considered adopting that as the most notable moment. I've seen drivers fail to start due to illness, but never have I seen one retire from a race before the end. I was hesitant to write about Logan struggling again, but when I watched the onboard footage from some of the other drivers struggling to extract themselves from their cars at the end of the race, I realized I wouldn't have to. This is bigger than one driver.

Stroll, stumbling into the medical van, then disappearing behind it as moments later members of his team rushed over.

Turns out everyone wrote about this.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
