Is it the media coverage?

Is it the culture?

How the thousands of people who work in F1 speak about their successes is remarkable. In other sports, even those with long-term points-based championships, it’s win or die.

One of the things I first noticed about F1 was the exclusivity of the points scoring. There were 20 drivers competing and six got points. Six. 

I guess it makes sense. If points are rare, achieving any points-paying position is an accomplishment, so the way the drivers and teams talk to the media about those small wins reflects that. Compare this to other race series where points are awarded even to last place, and the focus shifts to only celebrating the winner. This is the critical difference between F1 and others, and it’s one of the things that most attracts me to its culture.

There’s a palpable appreciation for small victories in F1. When you watch a race and listen to the drivers on the radio on the cooldown lap, nearly everyone is happy (expand on this). 

And when you watch the podium ceremony...I’m sorry, let me back up. They actually _have_ a podium ceremony. The top **three** drivers are awarded trophies, the winner gets to hear his national anthem, the team theirs, and we get to witness it all without such as a mousefart from the commentators.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
