Is it the media coverage?

Is it the culture?

How the thousands of people who work in F1 speak about their successes is remarkable. In other sports, even those with long-term points-based championships, it’s win or die.

One of the things I first noticed about F1 was the exclusivity of the points scoring. There were 20 drivers competing and six got points. Six. 

I guess it makes sense. If points are rare, achieving any points-paying position is an accomplishment, so the way the drivers and teams talk to the media about those small wins reflects that. Compare this to other race series where points are awarded even to last place, and the focus shifts to only celebrating the winner. This is the critical difference between F1 and others, and it’s one of the things that most attracts me to its culture.

There’s a palpable appreciation for small victories in F1. When you watch a race and listen to the drivers on the radio on the cooldown lap, nearly everyone is happy (expand on this). 

And when you watch the podium ceremony...I’m sorry, let me back up. They actually _have_ a podium ceremony. The top **three** drivers are awarded trophies, the winner gets to hear his national anthem, the team theirs, and we get to witness it all without such as a mousefart from the commentators. It's difficult to avoid apples & oranges arguments when comparing Indycar to F1...

Notes2: How do I present the content of the subtitle without using Indycar as a strawman? I need to stay focused on the remarkable nature of the culture, but how to show that uniqueness without a direct comparison? That's the challenge. 
- The podium is 3 drivers and a team member. Special attention is paid to the trophies (and now medal for the winner), and a different person receives the honor of presenting each trophy. The team's also hand-pick who represents them as the constructors trophy recipient, and it changes with every win. 
- The post race rituals are mandated by the FIA and performed to the letter. Each driver must weigh in, the podium finishers get a few moments to celebrate with their team, then they go to a cooldown room to hydrate and compose themselves. The TV coverage of this, by the way, is a fairly recent addition and deserves its own essay. It's one of my favorite things to witness during the race weekend.
- Some of these notes are notes for other essays, as it turns out. I'll have to draw focus back into the incremental progress and how everyone talks about it with positivity. 

Notes for next time: More on knowing themselves, the progress, and the overall perspective.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
