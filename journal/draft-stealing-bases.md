- Watching the kids play wall-ball or as we used to call it, "buns up"
- I catch myself wishing my kid did the same things I did, wishing he had fun the way I did
- Everything has a price - is this the price of growing up idyllically? Having it too good, so I want my kids to walk in my footsteps?
- My relationship with baseball soured when I got cut in highschool. At the time I thought it unjust, but as an adult I understand.
- The love for the game got rekindled when he started playing, and it kills me that he gets to have fun and my time is over.
- I help out at practice sometimes and it's fun, but it probably looks sad from the outside, like someone trying to rekindle something
- When does he get to play how he wants? When does encouragement turn into manipulation to fulfill vicariousness?
- Last night they suffered their first loss of the season. Why did I feel just as sad afterwards, and even a little longer than he?

Remember playing wall ball as a kid? Wall ball is a playground game involving a bunch of kids, a concrete wall, and a tennis ball. Everyone spreads out, one kid throws the ball as hard as they can against the wall, and the object is to catch rebound without bobbling it. If you fail to catch it cleanly, you have to drop it and run for your life toward the wall before another kid picks it up and pegs the wall first. If you touch the wall before the throw, you're safe. If the throw beats you there...

When I played as a kid, the consequences of "getting out" were higher than simply waiting until the game ended to get back in. Because we didn't call it wall ball. We called it "buns up". If you got out playing buns up, you had to assume the position against the wall, hands up and touching the brick with your back-side facing the rest of the kids. For the reward bestowed upon the kid who got you out was to stand at an agreeable distance and try to drill you as hard as possible in the butt cheeks. Hence the "buns" portion of buns up. The hit rate varied depending on who was on the firing squad, but there was always a chance they would miss, leaving you awash with relief and the rejuvenation to get back to it. The tradeoff we made for potentially sore bottoms was to rejoin the game immediately instead of having to wait until everyone got out.

I last played buns up in 8th grade and hadn't thought about it since then, but recently at the little league field where my son plays, I noticed a group of players throwing a tennis ball against the outside of the bathroom structure next to the snack shack. A pang of nostalgia rang out as I watched for a minute before it was time to leave. They weren't playing the buns up version, but it still looked just as fun. As we walked behind the kids to get to the parking lot, I expected my son to put his bat bag aside and join in. But he just kept walking beside me, like an uninterested adult who just wanted to avoid getting trampled by a ball-chaser or winged by an errant bounce.

When my son was born, I assigned a series of expectations based on my childhood. Some of these were typical fatherly things like teaching him to ride a bike, but others were based solely on my existing interests in the hopes we'd bond over them as he got older. But year after year, when he hit an age where I thought he would start liking the things I did...he didn't. This, of course, is how it's supposed to be. When you have kids your job is to be their parent, not their friend. In theory it's dead simple, but I underestimated the level of subtlety involved in trying to apply it. Remembering that discipline is more important than them liking me, for example, is easier to do than recognizing when I'm pushing them toward certain hobbies or activities because those are the things I like. A case can be made that the familiarity of those things is the gravitational force behind that behavior, but I'm beginning to discover my reasoning as not so pure.

Up until 11th grade, playing baseball was my biggest source of childhood enjoyment. I loved spending hours practicing alone in the driveway. I loved the comaradarie with my teammates who eventually became my friends. I loved to compete. That changed in high school and I fell out of love with the game, but I always knew if I had a son, as soon as he turned five we'd be signing him up for tee ball and that journey would begin for him. I did have a son, and he did turn five, and he did play tee ball. But the same love for the game didn't survive in the genetic cauldron, and though he's played every season since then, to him it's just something to do. He has fun, don't get me wrong, but unlike me at his age, he doesn't ask to play catch every day after school.

As we drove away from the field, leaving the gaggle of boys to their game of wall ball, I finally understood why his lack of passion made me sad. Up until this moment, I convinced myself the sadness was pity for him missing out on some of the best times I had as a kid. But that's a lie I told myself to avoid what was really happening. I've been trying to relive _my_ childhood. I talk a big game [link] about how incredible adulthood is, but I have vividly fond memories of my childhood, too. I think it's natural to want the best of what I had for my kids, but it becomes a bit gross if they're not as into it and I still push them to be. The things I loved may not be the things he loves, and any disappointment over that is a red flag that my priorities are in the wrong place.

I wish it didn't take me a decade to realize what I was doing. If I could sit my younger self down, I would tell him this: "Your kids will not be you. They're not supposed to be you. Show them the things you liked as a kid, but only show them. You're supposed to keep an eye out for what they like, and provide the best possible avenue for them to pursue it. If you only pay attention to whether or not they're into that same things you were, you'll be blind to all the things that make them who _they_ are." I think every parent wants to do a better job than their parents, even if they had a glowing childhood. Looking back, I never felt like I was being coerced into doing something just because they enjoyed it as a kid. Unfortunately, it looks like my son isn't so lucky. All I can do now is continue to recognize when I'm inadvertantly syphoning his childhood to rekindle mine, and fight the urge to influence him for the wrong reasons.

Notes for next time: list out some of the expectations I had when he was born. Talk about how slowly but surely, those expectations have been disproven. Talk about the lack of grip I actually have on his interests, and that it's SUPPOSED to be like that. Why on earth would I want him to be just like me? There's a larger part of me than I realized that wants to relive my childhood. I've talked (link) big talk about how incredible it is to be an adult, but my childhood was pretty killer too. It seems gross but natural at the same time to want the best of what I had for my kids. But the things I loved are not the things he loves, and my disappointment over that is a sign that my priorities are not in the right place. <-- This is the beginning of the end. Lesson to your younger self: "Your kids will not be you. Show them the things you liked, but ONLY show them. Give them the best possible version of the things THEY like. If I only look at the things they do that AREN'T what I did, I'll miss all the things they're actually interested in. i.e., what does he like? not, what does he not like that I liked?

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is utterly gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
