They're soaking wet with champagne, mentally spent, physically punished, and ecstatic to be there. They number just four, but they jostle together and squeeze themselves onto the step reserved for number one. These are your podium finishers. The fourth person is a representative for the winning team, who accepts the constructors trophy after the winning driver accepts his. The other two are the second and third place finishers, who through skill or luck or status quo, get to taste their own minor victories and a decent haul of championship points. And after the anthems' final measure and once the carbonation in the champagne bottles runs out, these four who for this brief period are comrades instead of rivals climb back up to the top step in recognition of their duty to the throngs of media below, who have precisely five seconds to frame, focus, and capture their depiction of today's result.

As they descend the steps and disappear behind the sponsorship-laden backdrop, I share in their satisfaction of another race in the books. Now, the race is truly over and _only now_ is it appropriate to stop watching.

Because the ritual isn't complete until that moment. And the ritual is a gift.

The rules in place for what happens between crossing the finish line and walking off the podium are written in stone. Every detail is carried out in accordance with FIA regulations and failure to adhere to these procedures and ceremonies results in fines. And I'm grateful for that. Because this is the ritual.

In every one of the 476 races I've watched, the post-race ritual included the same three elements: the anthems, the champagne, and the photo. And while they've tweaked things over the years, like adding the team representative (2017) and altering the time and place of the post-race interviews (2016 & 2019), those three pillars of the ritual remain faithful.

Some may scoff at the constraints of such rules. That lack of spontaneity tamps down the potential for unbridled organic drama. That, my friends, is what the racing is for. And though counterintuitive, it's _within_ these regulatory confines the essense of the drivers' personalities shines through. Listening to the team radio on the cooldown lap, seeing how the winner dives into the outstretched arms of his mechanics, and witnessing the waves of emotion as they listen to their national anthem on the podium, I get a crystal clear glimpse into the psyche of every race-winning driver.

It's one of many elements that make this sport so special. 

So don't sleep on the post-race ceremonies, orchestrated though they may be. 

Don't squander the ritual. 

Watch until the photo op.



When do you stop watching?

 This question is highly dependent on where you live and which broadcast is available. But let's pretend for a moment that we all agree an F1 broadcast consists of _at least_ the following:

- The FIA intro
<!-- - The "Hello everyone and welcome..." sub-intro -->
<!-- - The formation lap -->
- The race
<!-- - The cooldown lap -->
<!-- - The winner celebrating with his team -->
- The post-race interviews
- The cooldown room
- The podium, including: 
  - national anthems
  - trophy presentation
  - champagne showers
  - photo op on the top step with all three drivers and the representative from the winning team selected to accept the constructors trophy
<!-- - The graphics showing the final classification -->
<!-- - B-roll from around the circuit and race replays -->
<!-- - The outro -->

Notes:
I linger on the podium longer if the race was particularly exciting, wanting to continue soaking it in. Think Gastly's win at Monza





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
