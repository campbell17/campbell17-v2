"Ohh, man."
"We'll talk when you're out. That's twenty-four laps. Uh, could you weigh yourself for my numbers, please?"

This exchange between Logan Sergeant and his race engineer Gaetan Jego felt sad. 

<!-- I can't get anything out - outline time: -->
- Logan's race was incredibly lonely.
- He started alone in the pit lane, and he finished alone on track, with his teammate 43 seconds up the road.
- He crashed out of qualifying, destroying his car and robbing his mechanics of sleep.
- When you're inexperienced, your number one job is to gain experience.
- Crashing often is expensive in so many ways. The cost of the car is obvious, but the hidden costs are what kills. The extra time and effort everyone on the team has to put in. The opportunity cost of lost seat time. But perhaps most of all, the loss of good will in the paddock and subsequently around the world. 
- The team remains professional and puts on a brave face, but it's hard not to harbor subconscious resentment when one person's mistakes are responsible for you pulling all-nighters.
- The other drivers don't want to get to close, either, lest they catch the virus of poor performance and bad luck, too.
- So there you are. A ghost among the living in the paddock, and moving chicane on track.


Ending:
- Some drivers finished lower, some made more mistakes, some had more penalities, and some ______, but I can say unequivocally no one felt more alone as they climbed out of the car than Logan. 

Bad luck floats around in strange ways. What causes it? Why do some drivers attract it while others seem impervious? At Suzuka, two teams had drivers with calamatous weekends, but only one seemed to bleed over to the other side of the garage. 



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
