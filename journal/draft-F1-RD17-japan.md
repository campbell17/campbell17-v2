"Ohh, man."
- Logan Sargeant, after stopping his car on the marks in hit pit box and shutting off the engine of his Williams FW45.

"We'll talk when you're out. That's twenty-four laps. Uh, could you weigh yourself for my numbers, please?"
- Gaetan Jego, Logan's race engineer.

This concise exchange on race day at Suzuka sounded more than a little heartbreaking.

And I say "sounded" because to _read_ the words is to lose the heavy notes of demoralization in Logan's voice. "Quivering" might be too harsh a portrayal, but it was unquestionably shaky.

After crashing out on the final corner halfway through the first round of qualifying, Sargeant will start last in the race. But the news gets worse. The damage his car sustained led to an extensive rebuild between Saturday's qualifying and the race on Sunday, and the team exceeded the limit of replacement parts permitted, the penalty for which is death.

_*checks notes_ Excuse me, the penalty for which is starting from the pitlane.

When the race starts, the rest of the grid are already on their way to turn one at speed when Sargeant arrives at the end of the pitlane. The light changes from flashing yellow to solid green and he sets off to give chase. In a stroke of luck, he catches and overtakes Bottas, Ocon and Zhou who all sustained damage in the sprint down to turn one. He catches his teammate Alex Albon, who also took a heavy hit on the way to the first corner. When they both arrive at Spoon corner on the far side of the track, the safety car is deployed and the race slowed so marshals can clear the debris on the main straight.

After a disaterous Saturday, a sleepless night for the team, and a pitlane start, P17 after half a lap ain't so bad. It's a shame, then, the team were saddled with a 10 second penalty in addition to the pitlane start. So after one lap behind the safety car, he returns to the pits to serve his 10 seconds, leaving him in P19 with only Bottas behind. Things do not improve from here.

Once the race resumed, it takes only ten corners before Sargeant locks up his front tires and runs straight into the side of Bottas who was taking the outside line through the hairpin. Another trip to pit lane follows for fresh tires and a new front wing, with a five-second penalty for causing a collision not far behind. As he rejoins the track, a long sigh and his lamentation over locking up at the hairpin wafts through the team radio, to which his engineer responds with an empathetic "ok", followed by how many seconds the gap is to Bottas ahead.

Though not the youngest on the grid, Logan is still only 22 and a rookie. The first year is the hardest for all but the most prodigious talents, and the number one objective for inexperienced drivers is to gain experience. Unfortunately for Sargeant, his first Japanese Grand Prix doesn't yield the sort of experience one looks for when entering a race weekend. Crashing is typically frowned upon, but some attrition throughout the season is expected, especially for rookies. But unforced errors like Logan's crash in qualifying throw a huge wet blanket over the team, not to mention heavy clouds of uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the driver. It's expensive. And it's expensive in ways beyond the monetary value of broken parts and spilled fluids.

Time is money, and the extra time and effort eveyone puts in to reset the car back to zero is time not spent optimizing the package and strategy. The number one objective for inexperienced drivers is to gain experience and there's immense opportunity cost to the track time lost after a crash. But perhaps the most expensive hidden cost is the loss of good will in the garage.

The team members do their best to remain professional, but once a pattern of indidents starts forming, the mechanics all turn into ocular dart players, shooting side-eyed glances across the garage to one another. These people are human and it's hard not to harbor subconscious resentment for the person responsible for you pulling all-nighters. A distance begins to form around the driver. An invisible barrier that keep even other drivers in the paddock from getting too close, lest they catch whatever poor performance virus of which he seems afflicted. 

In the end, the Japanese Grand Prix was the consummate microcosm of what it's like to be an inexperienced driver in F1. Some drivers retired earlier and finished lower. Some drivers made more mistakes (Sergio Perez lost not one, but two front wings while clashing with other drivers). Some drivers had more on-track penalities (again, Sergio). And some drivers had to give up places to their teammates via team orders. But I can say unequivocally, no one felt more _alone_ as they climbed out of their car on Sunday than Logan.




<!-- I can't get anything out - outline time: -->
- Logan's race was incredibly lonely.
- He started alone in the pit lane, and he finished alone on track, with his teammate 43 seconds up the road.
- He crashed out of qualifying, destroying his car and robbing his mechanics of sleep.
- When you're inexperienced, your number one job is to gain experience.
- Crashing often is expensive in so many ways. The cost of the car is obvious, but the hidden costs are what kills. The extra time and effort everyone on the team has to put in. The opportunity cost of lost seat time. But perhaps most of all, the loss of good will in the paddock and subsequently around the world. 
- The team remains professional and puts on a brave face, but it's hard not to harbor subconscious resentment when one person's mistakes are responsible for you pulling all-nighters.
- The other drivers don't want to get to close, either, lest they catch the virus of poor performance and bad luck, too.
- So there you are. A ghost among the living in the paddock, and moving chicane on track.


Ending:
- Some drivers finished lower. Some made more mistakes (Sergio Perez lost not one, but two front wings while clashing with other drivers). Some had more penalities (again, Sergio). And some had to give up places to their teammates via team orders. But I can say unequivocally no one felt more alone as they climbed out of the car on Sunday than Logan Sargeant.

Bad luck floats around in strange ways. What causes it? Why do some drivers attract it while others seem impervious? At Suzuka, two teams had drivers with calamatous weekends, but only one seemed to bleed over to the other side of the garage. 



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
