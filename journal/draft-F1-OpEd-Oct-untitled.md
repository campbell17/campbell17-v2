The Mclaren-Coaster.

McLaren growth. At the time of Suzuka, they're standing on the second and third step of the podium. But early on, they were nowhere. Relate this to the rise, fall, and re-rise? *look at the numbers from the championship standings over the years, show how maybe other teams like Mercedes and Red bull and Ferrari never dropped below a certain level? Gotta see if this is even true.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
