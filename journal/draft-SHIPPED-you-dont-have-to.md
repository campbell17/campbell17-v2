You don't have to do everything.

It was back-to-school night for my 7th grader last week. Here's a snippet from the email about it:

We're excited to welcome you to Back-to-School Night this Thursday, September 12th! Here's a quick look at the evening's schedule:

- 6:00 - 6:30 PM: Join us in the Auditorium for a parent meeting with the administrative team and the Behavioral Health Team. There will be a brief Q&A session following the presentation.
- 6:30 - 8:00 PM: Visit your child's classrooms and meet their teachers! You'll follow your child's A-Day schedule, with each teacher presentation lasting about 10 minutes.

Maps and friendly Student Ambassadors will be available to help you navigate the building. Don't forget to bring a copy of your child's A-Day schedule!

It sounds so official. So important. So _mandatory_.

We did not go. After 3 kids and umpteen years of these things, the light bulb came on: events like this do not matter to me. Fool me 22 times, shame on me.

There are countless tugs on our time and attention that seem important. If I don't go to back-to-school night, it _seems_ like I'm uncaring about my child's education. As if the teacher is marking our names with frowny faces in red ink while the parents who sat with their knees agaist their tits all night got gold stars. But that's not true. The teacher had to prepare her slide deck regardless of our attendance. And what if we were prominent ER surgeons saving lives while on the night shift? Those parents missed it, do they get a red frowny face, too?

This sounds like I'm justifying not playing along by saying I don't actually have to play along. But think about all the things we say we have to do. Almost none of it is required. Even when talking about things we have to do _before_ we do the thing we have to do. The other day I cleared the standing water from a tarp in the yard wearing dress pants and a button down. I'd already gotten dressed for work and sat down before I realized I needed to do it, but instead of putting it off because I didn't feel like getting changed again, I just _did the thing_.

I suspect one of the reasons (https://campbellseventeen.substack.com/p/adulting-101)[being an adult] gets a bad rap is we take on unnecessary commitments because we think that's what we're supposed to do. But if we zoom way out and look at the commitment in question, often we find it doesn't contribute in any way to...well, anything. If one of my commitments is exercising, I can zoom out and immediately see how that will benefit my future and by extension, the futures of my loved ones. But what happens if I don't attend the PTO meeting where they discuss plans to expand the grounds of the middle school? Oh, you mean this 7 year-long infrastructure project, then end of which will arrive just in time for my son's senior year of college? I think I can skip this one.

Don't get me wrong. If your boss tells you a meeting is mandatory, you should probably make an appearance. You chose to work there. You work for them. If your doctor tells you to cut out red meat because your heart can't take it, you should probably eat some flounder. You want to live. You can't live without your heart. If the police tell you to step out of the car, you should probably (slowly) open the door and step out of the car. You ran the light. You pay the ticket. 

But if someone with no authority over you states you have to do something, you can probably weigh your options. And back to school night is optional.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.
