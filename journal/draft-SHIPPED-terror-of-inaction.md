The Terror of Inaction

People's dreams are boring. Like taxes and death, it's one of life's irrefutable constants. Now let's discuss one of mine. It's a recurring nightmare I've had for longer than I know, but it represents something I couldn't put my finger on until recently.

At its core, the dream consists of two parts. Setting up to do something, then doing it. But here's the nightmare part: I can never get set up. The versions of this dream most memorable to me are sports-related. I played hockey in hich school, so in those dreams I can't get my skates tied properly (or I forget some critical piece of equipment entirely) so I can never take the ice. In college I took up golf, so those dreams involve an inability to find steady ground on the first tee so no matter where I set the ball, I'm never ready to swing the club. A few months ago, I logged a new entry after watching an entire weekend of NFL games: I was the kicker and couldn't find a spot to put the ball to kick off because there was a fence in the way and I had to keep moving it so the game could never start.

I don't tell anyone about my dreams because, as stated earlier, fewer things are duller to the listener, so I was content to keep these to myself until my final nap in the dirt. But the introduction of a new hobby this winter spawned yet another version of the dream. The setting changed, but the premise follows the same formula. I'm on a ski slope. One ski is already attached and the other ski is on the snow, awaiting the satisfying engagement of my other foot into its binding. Unfortunately, I can't get my stance and the placement of the ski in enough harmony to pull the trigger and thus, I can never get going.

I know nothing about the relevance of dreams and I lack the curiosity required to fix that, but the most recent setting change for the same basic dream surprised me enough to take notice. I call these "nightmares", but they aren't scary in the traditional sense. But there _is_ something terrifying about them. Because I could argue these failure-to-launch dreams, in all their forms, represent an injustice of the soul. In them, I'm Sisyphus, but instead of rolling a giant boulder up a hill for eternity, I'm forever stuck at the final step before an action takes place. If I could only find a place to stand, I could take the plunge. 

There are things we know in our heart we _can_ do and there are things we know in our heart we _should_ do. We all have the potential to perform. To heed the call to adventure. To take action. And when we don't, a tiny part of the universe falls out of balance. These dreams are a reminder to always strike while the iron is hot. Because at some point, we'll have all the energy, motivation, and willingness to dance, but our old bones won't allow it.




Possible ending?: Sisyphus was punished for cheating the Gods, allowing him to escape his death twice. We may not be cheating 



Notes for the next lines: There are things we know in our heart we can do. There are other things we know in our heart we _should_ do. The injustice of the soul is another way of saying, not only are we not doing the thing we know we should, something is holding us back. Time is ticking away, the world is passing us by...the hockey game is going to start without us, our playing partners are standing impatiently, the football game can't begin, and we can't get down the mountain. We have the potential to shine, to perform, to fulfill our calling. But we don't. It almost feels like I'm being punished for all the time wasted doing trivial things when I should have been feeding my soul the things I was meant to do. <-- This whole paragraph, but done eloquently. After that: When I sit in useless meetings, of which there are many, I sometimes joke to my peers about ruing this time we're wasting while on my death bed. "When I'm on my death bed, I'm gonna be thinking about this meeting and how I wish I had this hour back." The dreams are a reminder to strike while the iron is hot. At some point, you'll have all the energy, motivation, and will to do what you know you should do...but time will have passed you by. We'll either be too busy, or worse, too old.

<!-- Notes for next time: What do these failures to launch signify about my longstanding relationship with action/inaction?  -->


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
