I watch until the photo op.

When do you stop watching?

This question is highly dependent on where you live and which broadcast is available. But let's pretend for a moment that we all agree an F1 broadcast consists of _at least_ the following:

- The FIA intro
- The "Hello everyone and welcome..." sub-intro
- The formation lap
- The race
- The cooldown lap
- The winner celebrating with his team
- The podium, including: 
  - national anthems
  - trophy presentation
  - champagne showers
  - photo op on the top step with all three drivers and the representative from the winning team selected to accept the constructors trophy
- The graphics showing the final classification
- B-roll from around the circuit and race replays
- The outro

Notes:
I linger on the podium longer if the race was particularly exciting, wanting to continue soaking it in. Think Gastly's win at Monza





DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
