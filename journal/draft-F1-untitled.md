F1 is the friendliest it's ever been.

I like when everyone gets along. There's thrill in conflict, sure, but I can never shake my deep desire for everything to be copasetic. And when two people are at odds, the romantic part of me is on the edge of his seat waiting for them to come to a mutual understanding, give each other a knowing nod from across the room, and resolve their differences with a Hollywood-style "you can be my wing-man any day" one-liner. In the two and a half decades I've been following the sport, Formula One hasn't exactly fit this mold. This makes sense when you consider what's at stake. Unlike other sports where disagreements in the field of play usually result in nothing more than an argument, motor racing clashes can have life and death consequences. But with the increases in safety and a new crop of young drivers who've been racing against each other since childhood, the vibe in the paddock is getting a lot more chummy.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
