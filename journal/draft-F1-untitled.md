Why would someone do that?

In Qatar, Lewis Hamilton took himself out at the first corner by cutting across the front of his teammate George Russell in an attempt to take the position. A friend of mine is relatively new to F1 and in discussing the race with him, he posed a simple question about the incident: 

| Why would someone do that? 

I said, "well...", and that's the only word I could muster. _I know_ why someone would do that, but trying to explain it to someone new to the sport uncovered an element of racing I take for granted.

To me, Lewis' move was within a plum hair of working. He had more room to give, but was uncharacteristically clumsy when he cut across the nose of George's car. To my friend, though, the crash was completely inevitable. My friend already knows enough about F1 to understand how little drivers can see from the cockpit, a fact sometimes lost to fans mesmerized by the higher vantage point of the onboard cameras. But just as the drivers develop a sixth sense for how much room they have beside another car, I've internalized the thousands of overtakes witnessed over years to know how a small adjustment of his entry would have seen Lewis through the corner instead of undoing his belts.

However, after seeing Checo Perez and Yuki Tsunoda fall victim to identically ambitious first-corner attempts two races later in Mexico City, I realize _my_ "sixth sense" comes with a bias I share with the drivers. Because the truth is, those moves into turn 1 _never_ work. Until they do. So while my friend correctly sees the reality - one car cutting across the front of another car - my bias shows me what might have been, _if only_.

The most famous quote about racing is courtesy of Ayrton Senna when being interviewed about his turn 1 crash with Alain Prost in the 1990 championship deciding race at Suzuka: 

| Being a racing driver means you are competing with other people, and if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver, because we are competing. We are competing to win.

Those moves never work. Until they do. And when they do, people rise to their feet. It's one of the things that keeps me coming back, race after race. The line between a sublime overtake and a 50 million dollar mistake is so fine that it can take a long time to develop the intuition to spot it. But once you do, you can't look away. I hope my friend sticks with it long enough to become blind to the obvious like I have. And when his friends ask him, "why would someone do that?", unlike me he'll have the correct answer at the ready: "Because they're a racing driver."




- In Mexico City it happened again. Twice. In turn 1 of lap 1, Sergio Perez went for the same move on the outside and took himself out. Then Yuki Tsunoda did the same on lap 68. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
