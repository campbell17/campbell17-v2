I have a secret. 

- A small part of my enjoyment of Formula One lies in its exclusivity. As an American fan, the amount of exposure afforded to me has changed over the years. Until recently, I had to make a conserted effort to procure decent coverage of just the races, let alone the additional reporting, analysis, and gossip associated with a major sport. 

Need a transition here

- The feeling of isolation from other fans comes with a tradeoff of that idiotic human trait of thinking I have the inside track on something special. It's identical to talking to a dullard about a band you like and their first response is "Oh, I liked them before they were popular."

- And to give you an idea of what I mean by isolation, here's the list of people I've ever talked to about F1 who had ever seen a race:
* The owner of a video game store I used to go to when I was in college back in 2001
* A guy on a cruise ship in 2018
* Three guys at work since 2021

- That's it. That's the list.
- One minor caveat to this is my introversion. I don't often initiate conversations with strangers and if I do, announcing my passion for racing isn't usually the hot topic. But I'm also not the hermit living in the creepy dark house at the end of the block. This is simply the combination of following a sport that isn't part of the national conversation, and my penchant for solitude, and a preservation of the delusion that I know something other people don't.

- And while I don't act that way outwardly if I encounter another fan, the instinct isn't too far below the surface. Look at this SubStack, for God's sake. The subtext of its entire premise is "Yeah, I've been into watching this thing for 25 years...it's no big deal...I dunno, you might have heard of it...it's called FORMULA ONE."
- But the recent surge in visibility, helped along by the incredible Netflix series Drive to Survive, is the very thing I needed to transform my quiet passion for the sport into an active creative project. 
- And even though it's hard to shake the "I got here first" instinct, whenever I discover someone else likes F1, the excitement of having someone to talk to about it obliterates any desire to compare weiner sizes over who has more race watches under their belt.

NOTES: This could end here, but it'd be pretty damn short. What else can I say: Talk about all the pent up opinions, ideas, talking points, and other unconcious views you've been holding on to and how they always just spill out when you talk to someone new. Remember that guy on the cruise ship? That was someone my wife worked with. He had no idea what he was in for (this is all horrible grammar, plz fix) when he intimated to me he was an F1 fan. Being the first person I talked to in 17 years, I was equally unprepared for my outburst. I made a mental note to myself that night: "Take it down a notch."

Also, there's still a part of you that wishes you were the only one who knew. When I see ads for the US GP, I wish I didn't. Shhh! Don't tell, then all the riff raff will get in. But I know this is counter productive. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
