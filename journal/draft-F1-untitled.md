Eavesdropping. Peeping. Snooping. Spying. Everyone loves a good people-watching session. We can deny it all we want, but that's like a child denying eating chocolate when it's already all over their face. Besides, to do so denies a fundamental part of our humanity over which we have no control. We learn by observing, so it's only natural our main method of self-education would double as entertainment. We scratch this itch with countless "reality" shows, but those offerings are scripted and staged. We rarely get chance to get a true glimpse behind the curtain. Even the all-access docu-series format of Drive to Survive, while dramatic and entertaining, is still molded to fit curated storylines and narratives aimed at maximizing entertainment value. Luckily for us, 13 years before Drive to Survive first aired on Netflix, Formula One began drawing attention to one of the seemingly innocuous pre-podium procedures. It's known as "the cooldown room".

Up until Hungary 2003, they showed B-roll in the few minutes between the top three finishers climbing out of their car and the walk out onto the podium.

2005 Bahrain had ugly red couches, but not at the next race in San Marino, or the following race in Barcelona. It returned the following race at the Nurgurgring for the European GP, then again gone the race after in Canada (the had cafeteria chairs and showed them briefly with a long lens, but no microphone). Next at Indy was the tiregate, and they showed the official talking the drivers through the stunted podium ceremony amidst the jeering from the crowd. Next, in France, they had countertop service and we got another mic'd room but only for about 4 seconds before they walked out. Nothing at the British GP next, or the German GP following. Nothing in Hungary, nothing in Turkey, only a tiny look at the edge of the bridge at Monza. Nothing in Belgium, nothing in Brazil (Alonso clinches), nothing in Japan, and finally to end the season, we do get one in China, albeit an ultra-crowded hallway.

2006, Bahrain is the first time we get an extended look into the pre-podium area, where the drivers drink water, dry off with a fresh cozy towel, and chit chat. But there are still numerous people standing around. It isn't until _____ the drivers get an official "private" area to themselves.

This is all wrong:
<!-- notes: 2005 Australia they showed them cooling off, but there wasn't a cooldown "room" per se. Find the earliest they showed the cooling off, and the earliest they showed them actually sitting with 3 chairs (found it - this was introduced race 2 of the 2014 season in Malaysia. Before that, they designated an area. But I don't know - 2013 US GP has the room and a few comfy chairs, but the drivers don't bother sitting. ). -->

Notables - 
First ever glimpse - Bahrain 2005
TireGate - USA 2005
I forgot all about "Multi 21, Seb" Malaysia 2013
Hat throw 2014 (Abu Dhabi?)

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
