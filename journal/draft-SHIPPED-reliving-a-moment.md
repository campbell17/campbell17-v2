I'd like to talk about a moment in time I cherish. It's a memory I have from my early teens. If I had to put a number on it, I'd say the entire moment lasted ten seconds. More than thirty years on, if I settle my mind and concentrate, I can produce the same chemicals in my brain that caused this memory to sear itself into my mind in the first place, sending me tumbling back in time and space to experience the moment again. It's akin to the way a solitary smell can rip us from our reality without our consent. One moment, we're walking down a city street when the smell from a nearby restaurant reaches us. Before our next step, we're seated at our grandmother's kitchen table at age seven in anticipation of a meal we ate there once and never again.

My moment begins with the call of the crows. It was the summertime, and I was spending a week visiting my best friend, doing my best to stay in touch after my family moved away earlier in the year. I was of the age of not having a clue what time it was when I woke up. And it was the sound hit me first. A murder of crows sending their morning announcements out into the treetops. It struck me to notice I didn't usually hear birds when I woke up during the summer. I guess they get hoarse after noon. This morning, however, I knew it was early. But this didn't bother me. There was a sense of urgency surrounding my time that week. The goal: maximum fun. And knowing the hours had barely ticked over into daybreak caused an immediate wave of excitement and relief to wash over me. There was no time to waste, so step one was avoiding sleeping the day away.

The shot of excitement was chased by an immense sensation of calm, as the breeze from the open window filled the room with fresh cool air. With the window open all night, I'd unconsciously scrunched my blanket up to my nose, optimizing the ratio between the cold and the cozyiness. I took a deep breath through my nose, eyes still closed, and my mind began to wander about all the things my friend and I might do that day.

The memory ends there. But it doesn't end with a lull. Because when I bring myself back to that time, the lasting symbol in my mind is that of unmitigated freedom. My friend's parents worked, so it was just us. We were too old to need supervision. Too young to need jobs. We had places we could go. Woods to explore. Games to play. Snacks to eat. Friends to meet up with. We could do all of it. Or we could do none of it. And there I lay, listening to those crows, feeling that breeze on my face, and waking up to the realization of just how precious that sensation was. Naive enough to not yet know how hard life can get, but wise enough to know it will get hard. I try not to pine for that moment when I relive it, but swim in all the feelings I felt back then, grateful that I was lucky enough to have one like it. 

We shouldn't ruminate on all the traumas, embarrassments, injustices, and pains of our lives. A picked scab never heals. Instead, we should be collecting as many ten second vignettes as we can along the way. Squirrel them away and guard them with your life. Every once in a while, practice putting yourself back in these moments and see how close you can get to the real thing. You'll be amazed at the joy a little meditative replay can produce.



Call off the search. It's now clear at last
you've robbed your own future, by clutching your past.

The convenience of lies, the gymnastics of minds
removes all your doubt. It's the world that's unkind.




DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
