I keep my cars. I keep my cars for a long time. I know people who are unattached to theirs, like it's a pair of jeans or something. For them, it's just a car, and I guess their desire for something newer or different is greater than their affinity for what they already have. But I get very attached to mine. Every time I get a different car, I believe I'll have it until it dies of natural causes, old, creaky, and decrepit. But every time, external circumstances force me to give up my precious before I'm ready. Next month my current car turns 11. I don't celebrate the car's birthday like some lunatic, but when I thought about its age I was reminded of the last time my car met an untimely end and, more specifically, the ride we took in the tow truck that night.

A tow truck is one of those services we hope we never need. It's a last resort-based business model. Like going number two in public or [add a second amusing example], it's something most people go to great lengths to avoid. On a stormy Florida night in the summer of 2013, I drove my oldest son to get his hair cut before we all left for vacation the next day. As we rounded the final turn off the main road, my hatchback, which was fitted with a modified intake from its previous owner, sloshed through a flooded section of road that was imperceptably deep. The aftermarket intake, mounted low to the ground to suck in air that was cooler than that of the heat-soaked engine bay, took a choking gulp of rainwater instead. Realizing what was about to happen, I tried to kill the engine before any damage was done, but after we got out and pushed the car into the gas station adjacent to the giant puddle, it wouldn't restart. I suspected (https://www.wiki.com)[hydrolock], but the diagnosis would have to wait. In the meantime, I checked my phone for the nearest tow service.

We waited in the car for the truck to arrive. Towing is a temporal oddity. They're always an hour away no matter where you are or what time you call. During this time, in between chats about video games with my son, I ruminated on never getting around to swapping this car's intake with the other version. Its inlet was mounted higher in the engine bay precicely to avoid what happened on this night. After 45 minutes, our savior pulled up. We got out to greet an enormous man. He was either in his sixties or his forties, depending on how hard life had treated him. After a brief recap and with our destination mapped, we all ascended into the cab of his flatbed.

The man was lumbering, slow, overweight, and though he seemed tired, I reckoned he could put in a harder day's work than most without breaking a sweat. Well...more of a sweat. He was highly sudoriferous. But this was Florida, so that tracks for everyone except Formula 1 drivers and people with skin conditions. He didn't let on that it was odd to tow it to my house as opposed to a mechanic. We were leaving the next day for a week and I figured whatever damage I'd done wouldn't get any worse in my driveway. I just wanted the ordeal to be over and I'd deal with the consequences on the other side of my vacation. So we set out on the 22 minute drive back home. I don't recall who broke the ice, but one of us didn't fancy sitting in silence for that long, and so began the small talk. Where we were going on vacation. What I did for a living. How many other kids I had. Then I asked him about his kids.

"Sixteen."

"I'm sorry, did you say..."

"Sixteen."

He didn't have a sixteen-year-old. He had _sixteen kids_. I was not expecting this. This was now all I wanted to talk about. At the time, reality shows featuring huge families were in vogue, with "19 Kids and Counting" among the most popular. I asked the man what he thought about having his family in the spotlight like that. He didn't hesitate. He professed deep distaste for notoriety and fame and he guarded his family's privacy like a dragon hoards gold. He continued, turning his attention to the damage money and fame ferry along with them, but I'd already boarded a train of thought about his first statement. I expected a run-of-the-mill response like, "Yeah, sure, then we could be millionaires, too". Instead, he cut the idea down at the knees without hesitation. Like he was ready for the question. Like he'd been asked the same question every day for a month. Because he probably had.

Skipping over the shame of that conversational redundancy, I was awash in admiration for how principled the man was. He didn't waver, balk, or even pause before hammering his stamp on the paper. "No. I want no part of that world." He knew exactly who he was. He was a towering, obese, middle-aged man with an empire of a family. Sweating from the Florida heat, dirty from hoisting broken-down cars for ten hours a day, and arthritic from sitting in the cab of a tow truck as he escorted them all over town. And he wanted to keep it that way.

<!-- Notes for next time: The driver and his story is the story. His many kids, the conversation about the popularity of big families on reality tv, and his fervent stance on keeping his privacy. This is what stuck with me. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
