_Feedback time!_

_Hey, everyone. If this is your first essay, welcome. I hope you enjoy it._

_For everyone else, I have a small favor to ask. Leave a comment after this essay telling me what, if anything, you like about this newsletter. Also, feel free to share something you would change if you were me. I appreciate you all and thanks for reading._

_Now on to this week's essay._

- Sometimes things work best by "force"
    - how reframing the circumstances adds forcing functions to reach desired outcomes
        - example: choosing to write a newsletter every day necessarily opens up the topic pool since there's no more time to be picky

*****************


NOTE: HEY - THIS IS JUST PARKINSON'S LAW. DON'T WRITE BORING STUFF ABOUT PARKINSON'S LAW. ABANDON THIS ESSAY.


*****************

Using the force.

- I liked Star Wars just fine, but I'm not a huge fan. I've never seen the Mandolorian, which I guess would be the pass/fail point for anyone posing as a modern fan of the franchise.
- But I'm going to steal and butcher one unmistakably Star Warsian phrase: use the force.
- I've been thinking a lot about why progress occurs and why it doesn't
- Mainly about the fact that it doesn't happen naturally unprovoked
- Plants grow not because something something, but because their conditions are optimal to faciliate photosynthesis (and other sciencey things that make them grow - look this us, obvs)
- For humans, physical growth is blah blah, but mental growth is hard-won
- Therefore, it takes a conscious (using this word a lot, maybe find an alternative?) forcing function to facilitate the motivation necessary to act on the ambition/desire (pick one) to grow. (shorten this sentence)
- If I'm supposed to do something, a lack of deadline is a death-sentence for progress
- I've been working on website changes for months. If it had to be done next week, you bet your ass I'd be making some desk-clearing-level decisions to speed things up. I'm FORCED to do so by the deadline, hence forcing function. Without that deadline, I'm free to aimlessly dabble around in different mental modes, looking for cool stuff to add and getting easily distracted.
- This newsletter is living proof that it works. In week 3, I decided I publish Friday morning. *Every* Friday morning. Is this arbitrary? Of course it is. But the details of the deadline are immaterial compared to the outcome it provokes.

<!-- - One problem I'm having lately is the inability to stack parallel activities
- I can manage one essay per week, but everything else is scattershot
- The longer deadlines of the other activities seem to be keeping me from completing them
- I'm designing a tattoo for my daughter who recently turned 18. (not sure if I want to keep this in) If she had the appointment set for next week, I would drop everything and grind to get it done. But she doesn't She says "whenever you have time", which is about as good as saying "don't ever work on this".
- But that's what I mean about concurrent. To push one thing across the line, everything else has to pause. 
- I've tried to section...I'm just realizing I'm talking about process, which is boring. Abandoning this thread -->

- Do I ever get to stop making progress? That depends. When I stopped drawing for 7 years, I didn't particularly miss it, but I had many other things to do that warranted my undivided attention. Once those things ran their course, the free time I inherited yearned to be filled with something worthwhile.
- But I don't believe this is true for everyone. 
-  

Notes for next time: finish the outline, get started writing.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- Do you, but be consistent.
