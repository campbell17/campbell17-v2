So what happened in Mexico City? What can we deem remarkable?

- Qualifying was weird. Where did the Ferrari pace come from?
- Checo was in the lead for about 10 meters - when it isn't your year, it isn't your year
- Did the crowd leave after Checo was out?
- Magnussen's car threw him off the track in an old-school way, leading to a red flag
- Max set another record
- Logan had to retire in the last corner, disappointing but he still ran the whole race
- Lando was racing a different category - P17 to P5
- Lewis is excited
- Aston double DNF, data doesn't tell the story (graph comparing Aston to Mclaren points haul ytd, qualifying pre-show?)
- Ricciardo rock solid
- Is Alfa Romeo is the most invisible team of all time?



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
