When I was a little kid, my friend's and I threw stones at cars to pass the time. I don't mean we sidled up to the edge of the economy parking at the airport and did our best John Elway at the parked cars. That would be bad enough, but no. We stood on a side street, poised and obscured by the tree line, anxiously awaiting the next car to drive by so we could proceed to hurl whatever rocks we found along the road in its general direction.

Whenever I hear anyone complain about how kids today never go outside because "they're always staring at their devices, slack-jawed and drooling", I recall the memories (yes, plural) of what a pre-internet childhood sometimes involved. 



Note from Roam:

Something about whenever I hear someone talk about how todays kids have no attention span and the internet makes them stay in side, I think about some of the things my friends and I used to do long before the invention of the internet. We threw rocks at cars. Yeah.

Can I invent an outline for this thing?

- Teaser
- modern complaints
- "without the internet", then tell the story about getting caught in the first memory
- my obsession with rock throwing and how, against all common sense, didn't stop after getting caught
- breaking the window in the house across the street
- breaking the window of the car and hearing the scream
- going back out to retrieve the water bottle (a.k.a. evidence) and seeing the squad car
- the miracle that was not getting stopped and questioned despite the fact that I was a preteen out after dark
- having dreams about committing crimes, while probably common, but the guilt of this act fuels the intensity
- the knife edge of life paths - we all make mistakes, some of us insanely stupid ones - a roll of the dice can be all that keep someone from a completely different outcome
- I'll never be able to answer for that act, I just have to be grateful that it terrified me instead of emboldening me.
