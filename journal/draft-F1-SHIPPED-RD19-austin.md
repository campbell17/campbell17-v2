You don't boo excellence.

I never understood this, and I never will. Max takes the win, fighting through brake problems and uncertain grip levels to place himself in the ultra-exlusive company of the the 50+ win club. An achievement marking him as only the fifth driver in Formula One to do so joining Prost, Schumacher, Vettel, and Hamilton. And what do the chicken shit fans in Austin do? They boo him on the podium. Aggressively. This is wrong. There are certain times when it's absolutely appropriate to express your displeasure as a sports fan. When your team is getting annihilated because they keep making dumb mistakes, you boo. When the other team's players run out of the tunnel to take the field, you boo. And when the referee keeps making terrible calls, you boo.

But you don't boo excellence.

Acting this way is evidence the fans in Austin have a flawed understanding of the sport. Formula One isn't like other sports where "us against them" is the prevailing storyline. I understand people have opinions and not everyone likes every driver, but to display such hostility is to forget every driver is risking their life for our entertainment. Arguments on social media attempted to defend the booing as being directed not at Max, but at the governer of Texas handing him the trophy. Two things stand out to me about this: 1) The governor's presence doesn't explain the overt and deplorable jeering and chanting over the Dutch national anthem, and 2) Choosing to taint the podium ceremony with irrelevant vitriol aimed at the trophy presenter only further proves a lack of respect for the entire sport. What should have been a proud moment for someone who's done nothing but excel at his craft, exceeding even the highest levels of hype surrounding him since childhood, instead transformed into an embarrassing demonstration of classlessness. The turnout for the race was fantastic. But you don't attend Formula One to boo anyone, let alone the race winner.

Which brings me to my final point. Elite athletes are impervious to booing. They use everything at their disposal to fuel their competitive fire, _especially_ negativity. So the louder you boo, the more coal you shovel into their competitive furnace. So when Lando climbs his podium step, go ahead and chant his name. And when Lewis pounds his fist over his heart, cheer as loud as you can. But when Max bows to receive yet another winner's medal around his neck, what's a disgruntled Checo fan supposed to do? Pocket your hands. Because silence hurts. Boos do not.

And you simply don't boo excellence.





When I was younger I took a trip to Ireland. It was the first time I left the country. I remember feeling conspicuously foreign and, young as I was, consumed with the preoccupation of avoiding embarrassement. I was on high alert to act more polite, patient, and courteous than usual because I wanted to represent my country as well as possible. I wasn't being fake. I was simply on my best behavior. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
