Clogged toilets. 

- But, we have to fight these battles, we're all alone in the bathroom (find out what to cut from this, i.e. where to start it)
- whatever goes wrong you have to handle it
- you ever go to a big party, go in the bathroom, flush the toilet, and the water starts coming...up?
- This is the most frightening moment in the life of a human being (I think end it here)

I use too much toilet paper. In terms of square inches, tonnage, carbon footprint, however you want to measure it, it's too much. I you asked me to predict the one place my life would lack balance, I'm betting I wouldn't have guessed in the bathroom. And the cost is more than a decimated pulpwood tree population. This habit results in me facing the rising water crisis more frequently than most people.

Immediately, there's a mental hurdle to climb. In fact, there are several. The first is the audacity of the toilet to not do its only job and make the contents of the bowl disappear in seconds. It's akin to a social fuax pas, and we need to make short work of the initial shock because the next hurdle is hot on its heels: locating the plunger. This one is only learned through experience - the experience of not having one handy. If it's our house, we have no excuse. Every toilet needs a plunger beside it. Buy one of those little caddys if you must, but it needs to be reachable while our pants are potentially still grasping our ankles. In someone else's house, locate one before you start or risk the terror of which Seinfeld speaks.

The next mental roadblock is admitting we need to intervene. Putting anything we're holding into the toilet water is gross. The end of our probe will possibly be touching things unspeakable, and we won't necessarily have an exit strategy when its over. Blind committment is the only thing that will save you. This is Apollo 13 and stopping the water from rising any higher is like regulating the peaking CO2 levels. All other concerns will have to wait.

To that end, time is of the essence, which is why knowing the location of our declogging implement before a disaster occurs is crucial. We have around 3 seconds to not only recognize this whole endeavor is going sideways, but to put a plan into action. 

Then there's the ill-conceived name of the plunger. To plunge is to dive downward, but that's not how declogging works. At least not in most household toilets in America. Compressing the wad of teepee only strengthens its resolve, and like a wolf backed into a corner, it will only fight harder to stay alive. We have to reverse our perspective and our tactics and merely _press_ the plunger firmly into the bottom opening. Picture a player at the NFL combine squatting down before they set a new record in the vertical jump.

Now it's show time.

With both hands gripping the handle like a $500 Easton bat, yank _up_ on the plunger until it pops back into its resting shape. The key is to apply the most violent motion we can in the shortest distance possible, like Beatrix using her 3" coffin punch to escape after being buried alive in Kill Bill. However, there are two bear traps we need to avoid in this, the most important step. Trap number one, too little water in the bowl. The rubber bottom on the plunger _must be completely submerged_ before giving it a yank. No water means no suction, but some water means the small amount resting in the recess we created with our press will come rocketing out towards our face. Usually the water is rising so fast this isn't an issue, but if it's a softer clog or if we've taken too long to get into position, the water can recede below acceptable levels. When in doubt, we can pull up gently the first time to see if there's ample suction and water coverage. If not, and this takes some faith, we can flush again to add more water so we can take a proper crack at it. Trap number two, we do not want to continue the pulling motion past the plunger-shape-reformation stage. If we pull up too wildly, we risk the humiliating trifecta of pulling the plunger all the way out of the bowl, falling to the floor, and having the heaving wave of jettisoned water splash over us like a gentle breaker at Daytona Beach.

When executed properly, it takes but a single pull of the plunger handle to unseat the wad and send it packing. Now we dip the plunger back in the clean water and give it a swirl, tap tap tap it on the inside of the bowl, and in one smooth motion, swing it back into its staging area beside the toilet, caring not of the madness that may or may not be resting on our designer tile underneath. We wash our hands before clearing the sweat from our brow, and exit the restroom with a cheerful whistle, letting everyone in earshot know that precicely nothing noteworthy happened in there.






This is an essay about how to unclog a toilet. Once you do it once, you can do it always.


Rule number one: have a plunger beside every toilet. Rule number two: lobby the plumbing industry to relabel plungers to pullers.

A plunge is a dive. It's a downward motion toward the earth's core. But plunging a clog usually compacts it, making it worse. So while the first move is to _press_ the thing down, the problem isn't solved until you pull.

There are obstacles. Number one, gross. Number two, time. Number three, risk. (expand on these)

It takes faith.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
