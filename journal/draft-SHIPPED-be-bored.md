Idea Cycles

<!-- My youngest son is 12. How will he look at the world in 10 years? I don't mean geopolitically. I mean his world. His immediate surroundings. How will he tackle new problems, the unexpected, and the unknown? 

He loves gaming, which I don't mind. I love it too. But gaming is not the real world. It doesn't inspire action, as such. Most often it provides an escape. For 99.9% of us, they're nothing more than a time waster. Don't get me wrong, I'm a time waster from way back. (In a previous essay)[...] I catalogued the unending list of sports I waste my time on annually. But I've developed an internal timer that goes off when I'm being too wasteful for too long. The boy does not have that. Yet.

The problem with not having a timer like this, is there's no sense of what the cost is. Let's look at two scenarios:

In one, he plays video games at the same rate for the next ten years. The rate is "however much he can get away with". In the other, he limits himself to a set time per day and doesn't cheat. Let's be generous and give him two hours. For context, it's summer right now and in a heavy week with his friends on vacation and no day camps scheduled, he was hitting up to 10 hours per day. We'll come back to that later.

There's an 8 hour delta between his worst day and an average time-limited day. Let's add another constraint of this thought experiment and leave TV out of the equation. We can simplify everything and just call it all "screen time". 
 -->
<!-- If he's on a screen for the extra 8 hours, he isn't bored. If he isn't bored, he isn't thinking of anything to quell his boredom. If he isn't thinking, he isn't generating ideas. If he isn't generating ideas, he isn't getting curious. If he isn't getting curious, he isn't learning about the things he's curious about. If he isn't learning new things on his own, he isn't expanding himself naturally. He isn't learning how to learn. Think about the energy boost you get from learning something new when your own curiosity is the catalyst? Now consider the opposite - mandated learning by someone else. An assignment. No thanks, Teach.

If we look at the next ten years on his timeline, we can consider gaming as a flat line. No growth. One could argue that gaming teaches us new things, but those people have never hammered a nail in their life. To grow into and beyond our potential requires interacting with the physical world from time to time.  -->

In elementary school, I used to disassemble my clicky-top pens to see what was inside. I was curious to understand how they clicky-topped. When my classmates were looking for things to tease me about, this came in handy. Regardless, I was amazed to discover how simple the mechanism was once all the parts were out on my desk. Through a small amount of curiosity, I learned something new. "I guess I know all about pens now." I began to look around for other things to take apart. "I wonder what else I could figure out."

Asserting mastery over something as insignificant as a ballpoint pen made me feel handy. It made me feel _competent_. It gave me a break from constantly praying I wouldn't get called on in class, unable yet again to guess what the topic was about, let alone give the correct answer. I'd been bored so I stopped paying attention, and it was that very boredom prompting me to take notice of my pen in the first place. 

<!-- More on that later. (Idea: what if we scheduled a block of boring time? 2 hours - you can do anything you want, except read, watch TV, or play a game. The game one is tough - no board games or puzzles, either? I think so, because what we're after is exploration of creative thinking. DOing something to quell the boredom instead of merely passing the time mindlessly with a distraction.) -->

My youngest son loves gaming, which I don't mind. I love it too. It provides a nice escape. But gaming is not the physical world. It doesn't inspire locomotion. And worse, it fills in all the time gaps where boredom might otherwise reside. Once in a while this is fine. It's when the hours start climbing we run into a problem. Because every hour he spends gaming is an hour he isn't bored, at least not consciously. If he isn't bored, he isn't thinking of anything to quell his boredom. If he isn't thinking, he isn't getting curious. If he isn't getting curious, he isn't generating ideas. If he isn't generating ideas, he isn't learning about the things he's curious about. If he isn't learning new things on his own, he isn't expanding himself naturally. He isn't learning _how to learn_. Picture the energy boost you get from learning something new when your own curiosity is the catalyst. Now consider the opposite, when someone else says you have to learn something. Maybe it's just me, but my enthusiasm gets sapped every time. I have to rearrange the incentives to trick myself into believing it was my idea.

I'm afraid if my son does nothing but game with his free time for the next 10 years, he won't develop a taste for the value of the time between activites. The time when nothing is calling for our attention. This time is sacred. But everywhere we look, there's a new game, show, reel, podcast, or YouTube video to consume. The preponderance of infinite scrolling has put a massive dent in our natural need for boredom, almost to the point of extinction. Even I, someone agressively self-aware about device usage, have to slap my own wrist every day to keep from pulling my phone out and wasting the in-betweens. So a few weeks ago, I had my son embark on a project. Something in the physical world. Something within his grasp but just at the edge of his circle of competence. A real problem to solve. And we found it in the bathroom of all places.

He is charged with not lifting the toilet seat up to pee sometimes, leading to more than a few mishaps due to poor aim. His older sister is tired of cleaning up his messes and can't fathom why he never remembers to do it. We zero in on the culprit: the lid for this particular toilet seat overhangs the whole assembly slightly, making it difficult to lift both the seat _and_ lid at the same time. It's not _actually_ difficult - I can do it just fine - but for a 12 year old already grossed out by touching _any_ part of the toilet, it's a non starter. What we need - what he needs - is a little handle of some kind, attached to the seat, that he can grab easily allowing him to lift both at once without giving it a second thought. We always trip over that second thought.

I bring him into the bathroom one morning and explain the details. Clean the seat. Remove the seat. Bring the seat to the workbench. Find something to attach to act as a handle. Attach thing. Reinstall the seat. I also give him constraints. It can't be too thick so the seat doesn't rest properly down. It can't stick out so much it gets in anyone's way.

The project goes well. At first he's daunted, but when asked afterword how he felt to solve that problem on his own, he answers "amazing". His sister isn't annoyed any more, he made good use of his non-gaming time, and he solved the problem. Win-win-win. But something else happened to him while he was descending upon this problem. Something subtle that I didn't notice until we were talking about things afterward. He knows about tape now.

Anyone who's ever tried to affix one thing to another thing understands how unwilling each participant can be. Even in a battle between two pieces of plastic - say, the bottom of a toilet seat and a scrap of 3D printing filament found in the basement - the outcome is uncertain. But in opting to use tape as his adhesive of choice, my son uncovered the first rule of problem solving: it's rarely as simple as it seems. 

My five all time favorite tapes are VHS, police, mix, sex, and tale of the.[1] But I'm not talking about those tapes. The _actual_ tapes all sat somewhat unkempt amongst each other on a shelf in the garage. Hockey tape, duct tape, electrical tape, double-stick tape, painter's tape, fiber-reenforced tape, and clear packing tape. I showed him his options and he grabbed the fiber-reenforced tape first. It was white and seemed pretty sturdy. I went back upstairs as he descended into the basement to try it out.

Later, when he showed me the finished product, he explained how his first choice came unstuck almost immediately when tested so he opted for duct tape. This rudimentary event - trying something, observing how it failed, and trying a new solution - is a cornerstone of learning. Our expectations get put on trial with each attempt, and when something doesn't work, we have to send that solution to the electric chair. Even a small project like this produces dozens of decisions, each potentially requiring further expansion of familiarity, knowledge, and ultimately competence in multiple categories. The first thing my son had to do was clean the seat. That alone expanded his world. What cleaners are there? Where do we keep them? Do I wear gloves? What kind of gloves are there? Where do we keep those? It's not safe to flush the paper towels? Why not? 

It seemed like an arrow-straight problem to solve. Now he's learning about septic systems.

This, in a nutshell, is what happens when we _do_ stuff. Each thing we touch contains 5 sub-things we need to touch and we need to learn a little about each one as we go. It's exponential. And everything is connected. The knowledge he gained while figuring out how to remove the toilet seat will apply to something he works on 3 years from now. "Remember the plastic housing each bolt screwed into? They had those fins on the sides to make it easier to grip in tight spaces." The value of projects like these finds its roots in the soils of boredom. Think of all the tiny ideas we could have in a 10 year span if we replaced one hour of scrolling per day with pure, stare-out-the-window boredom. I think I'll start today.

<!-- Up next: we want to talk about the tape, so be brief with the setup, talk about how he felt before he started vs. how he felt once achieved the result. Talk about the trial and error. Then talk about the tape. He had little concept of what existed. It was a black hole. Now he knows all about tape. -->


<!-- Notes for next time - talk about the gains we make by being bored, the things we learn when we didn't even know they were part of the thing we were actually trying to do/learn. He had to attach a thing to another thing. Now he knows about tape. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.
