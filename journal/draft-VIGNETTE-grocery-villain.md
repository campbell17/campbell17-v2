Hi all,

I'm trying something new this week, adding a "micro-story" to the weekly rotation. These will be random and apropos of nothing, hence the subtitle, and are a chance to experiment with different styles, subjects, and points of view than I typically publish. My Friday essays will continue as scheduled, and I'm hoping the freedom of these short stories will introduce some yet-to-be-determined possibilities.

I hope you enjoy, and whether you do or not, let me know what you think!

Episode 1

The guy who bagged our groceries was sweet to extend forgiveness for not wanting to "round up and donate" our change to the corporate charity tax-break scam du jour. He intimated that while his car has been in the shop, he hasn't had the money to tip the Uber drivers bringing him to work because doing so would mean failing to pay his bills on time.

"Oh I have the money, I just choose not to donate."

We all laughed (except for the horrified checkout girl whose offended expression had no effect). I said thank you and we walked away. For his part, our bagman, Chris or something, played along as if our brazen insensitivity were merely an ironic facade masking our truer, more benevolent dispositions.

As we walk toward the only Porsche in the parking lot and burst out laughing again at the irony of that, I'm confident he will change his mind. Now at least one person believes I'm either evil or terminally cruel. Only 7+ billion more to go.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
