_The Op-ed is a monthly essay for paid subscribers where I take a step back and look more broadly at the state of Formula One. I appreciate you so much for your support. -Tim_

Mistakes Were Made.
Pay no attention to the stewards behind the curtain.

They seem like good ideas at the time. Misjudgements. Miscalculations. Blunders. What begins as innocent and well-meaning attempts to make things more interesting - to make them _better_ - ends with us having to commission a tattoo to cover up the huge scar.

We're two seasons removed from one of the most exciting and controversial championship finales in the history of F1. With fans across the globe collectively screaming at their televisions, Max Vertappen's overtake of Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the final race of the season provided more drama than a movie script. _Script_, in this case, being the operative word. Because the cicrumstances required for this specific ending to come to pass involved the manipulation of well-established procedures and the orchestration of a "shootout" between the championship rivals. The outcome itself, i.e. who took the win and with it the championship, took a back seat to the controversy and ultimately, the mistake. But the mistake wasn't the shootout or the orchestration or the manipulation of round 22 in Abu Dhabi. Instead, the mistake came back in round 4 at the Spanish Grand Prix.

At first it was amazing. Long time fans of the sport already knew the teams were in constant contact with the FIA[1] during the race weekend, but Spain introduced the ability for fans to hear the actual radio messages during the broadcast. Now instead of _imagining_ what it sounded like for a team principal to complain to the stewards about their driver getting forced off the track by another car, we would hear it verbatim. It was an interesting glimpse into the "game within the game". But the two fatal flaws of this feature didn't reveal themselves until the pressure was at its highest. The knowledge of the messages being broadcast to the public coupled with the teams ability to communicate with the race director without an intermediary formulated the perfect conditions for a collapse under the weight of the moment. In the end, the focus of the broadcast became more about the back-channel lobbying from the teams to the FIA than the racing.

A major strength of Formula One is its ability to adapt and iterate. They removed these new windows into the behind-the-scenes world of a race weekend almost as swiftly as they were introduced. In the aftermath of the Abu Dhabi controversy, changes were implemented to give the race director more "peaceful" conditions to make decisions, including cutting the direct line of the team principles. 

Notes for next time: I need an ending - the main idea was "F1 is best when no one knows the names of the governing body members" but my take so far is just a recap of what happened in 2021. Where's the juice? 


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
