_The Op-ed is a monthly essay for paid subscribers where I take a step back and look more broadly at the state of Formula One. I appreciate you so much for your support. -Tim_

Are you not entertained? 

Man, do I love a good dynasty. Watching a display of consistently dominant performances sustained over multiple seasons, I can't help but feel privileged to behold the greatness first-hand. This, however, is not a sentiment shared by everyone. Every time the regime changes, the peanut gallery rejoices as they praise the new king for usurping the boring old king and bringing some variety back to their beloved F1. 

Then the new king starts winning a bit _too_ often and the cycle repeats.

I never understood this. We follow sport to see athletes do all the incredible things of which humans are capable. We, the uncoordinated, the unwashed, and the unfit, are _incapable_. So we sit behind the fence and watch. Who are we to call into question _how good_ a driver or team should be?

For many, the predictability of outcome in the midst of a dynasty is simply too difficult to overlook. There's a deep irony that the more special a driver or team is, the less special they make their achievements look. In some races, the dominance feels almost banal. But failure to recognize the greatness of boring dominance is not the fault of the drivers and teams. It's our fault.

What sort of person buys a plane ticket to Florence, tells the taxi driver "Portami alla Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze, per favore", sidles up to Michelangelo's David and thinks, "Meh, it's too perfect. Borrringgg." So why do we do that with dynasties?

Think of the amount of human effort needed for a team like Mercedes to win their _eight consecutive_ constructors titles. Let's do some quick conservative fuzzy math: 1,000+ individuals working 50+ hour weeks. Eight years of this, minus summer breaks, and for simplicity let's pretend everyone just chilled the entire off-season (spoiler: they didn't). This adds up to ~288 weeks. **That's 14.4 million hours**.

By the way, _every other team followed a similar blueprint_. And do they have eight consecutive constructors championships? Fuck no.

We're currently on the brink of another dynasty. If Max and Red Bull hold this trajectory, there's no ceiling on what they could achieve. But maybe instead of complaining to our annoyed coworkers how boring it is to watch Michael, or Sebastian, or Lewis, or Max win all the time, we should show a little appreciation for the pure excellence laid bare before us. We never know if we'll get a chance to see it again.


- What's not to like? Why do we watch sport?
- Sometimes the measure of an athlete is how well they make the special look unspecial.
- But failure to recognize the greatness of boring dominance is not the fault of the drivers and teams. It's your fault.
- What sort of person buys a plane ticket to Florence, tells the taxi driver "Portami alla Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze, per favore", sidles up to Michelangelo's David and thinks, "Meh, it's too perfect. Borrringgg."

- Failure to appreciate greatness like this always puzzles me. Think of the amount of human effort needed for a team like Mercedes to win their _eight consecutive_ constructors titles.

There's a comfort - a tranquility, even - in knowing the outcome before anything even starts.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
