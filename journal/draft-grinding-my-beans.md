Last year I bought a hand-operated single-serving ceramic conical burr grinder. Every morning I grind two tablespoons of coffee beans by spinning a long handle around an aluminum cylinder for ninety seconds. I look ridiculous doing it. It feels longer than ninety seconds. I think it's giving me tendonitis.

There are more efficient ways to grind coffee beans.

Occasionally, I get a little overzealous when I transfer the beans from the tablespoon to the skinny mouth of the cylinder and a few of them escape and hide under the desk. I have to put everything down, scoot the chair out of the way (being careful not to run over the escapees), decide whether or not to tempt fate by using unclean beans, and plink them back in with their friends.

There are more dignified ways to grind coffee beans.

I pour the water add the sweetener and when the gurgling arrests after a minute or two, I get to enjoy _one_ cup of coffee.

There are more scalable ways to grind coffee beans.

More _scalable_.



For next time (maybe? Not sure where this is going quite yet...) - When I hear the word scalable, it brings to mind utopian fantasies about creative efficiency. "If I set everything up correctly, the next time will produce double the thing in a fraction of the time!"


What is the surprise of this story?
