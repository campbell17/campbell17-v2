Last year I bought a hand-operated single-serving ceramic conical burr grinder. Every morning I grind two tablespoons of coffee beans by spinning a long handle around an aluminum cylinder for ninety seconds. I look ridiculous doing it. It feels longer than ninety seconds. I think it's giving me tendonitis.

There are more efficient ways to grind coffee beans.

Occasionally, I get a little overzealous when I transfer the beans from the tablespoon to the skinny mouth of the cylinder and a few of them escape and hide under the desk. I have to put everything down, scoot the chair out of the way (being careful not to run over the escapees), decide whether or not to tempt fate by using unclean beans, and plink them back in with their friends.

There are more dignified ways to grind coffee beans.

I pour the water add the sweetener and when the gurgling arrests after a minute or two, I get to enjoy _one_ cup of coffee.

There are more scalable ways to grind coffee beans.

More _scalable_.

Take a moment to visualize that word. When you hear the word "scalable", what comes to mind?

What comes to my mind are things like factories and assembly lines and fast food restaurants. Billion dollar industry things.

Scalability is the measure of whether or not a perceived experience can be maintained as you add volume. For example, it takes about five minutes to make one cup of coffee for me - one person - every morning. 

Sounds reasonable. 

However, if I owned the MGM Grand hotel and my 9,992 guests all wanted a cup of coffee, it would take 832 hours and 40 minutes before the last person in line got theirs. (For the curious, that's 34 days, 8 hours, and 40 minutes. That better be _some_ coffee.)

Clearly, my artisinal methods of highly-sophisticated drip coffee production are not scalable.

note for me - I'm having trouble articulating what the issue is. There's something about trying to think too far (or at all) into the future when you're solving a problem can ruin the solution for the problem you're solving right now. It's an offshoot of analysis paralysis (or maybe it's just that, no offshoot required). But what, specifically, am I talking about? Overengineering? Overthinking? If I bought the 5 cup coffee maker on the off-chance I'd have to make my coffee for everyone in the house, I'd have a sub-optimal solution for my every day needs, but the perfect solution for the scenario that may or may not ever happen. The opposite is I solve this problem for me right now and, beyond giving it a cursory thought, don't worry at all about the future. Humans are a future-oriented species which is why we're able to save money for retirement, eat healthy things when clearly they're not as tasty as junk, exercise even though our lifestyles no longer require it (i.e. most of us don't have to run until our dinner is too tired to keep fleeing). But that future-orientation is a stifling force, preventing me from getting out of my own way and putting in the artistic mileage. When I was a kid, I drew for fun. I drew cartoons of my friends, athletes on baseball and football cards, characters from movies, planes, guns, animals, houses. I enjoyed drawing, so I drew. Today, everything is a goddamn negotiation. "What benefit will this earn me down the road? Is this something I might be able to sell? Where is this leading? Am I planning on making a series of these and putting them up in a gallery? Could I make these into stickers? What if I go through all the trouble and no one buys any? Am I going to post this on social media? Which platform? Should I film myself drawing so I have more content?" What the fuck, man. Draw the thing, asshole. Every creative decision is now laced with scalability questions. But I have a plan. Make cool shit is the name of my plan. Have you ever gone to IMDB and looked at a performer's timeline? "Oh dang, look at all the stuff she's been in..." That's the structure of my plan. By the end of the year, and every year, I want a timeline of cool ass projects that I _shipped_. Not stuff I started, or I'm thinking about maybe doing, or I have an idea for. No. Shipped work. When one of my kids was younger, he was at the doctor a lot. Every time we checked out of the office, he got a sticker. Sometimes he peeled off the backing and slapped the sticker on his chest, but at some point he decided he wanted to hand me the sticker as soon as we got in the car for safe keeping. I eventually realized I had dozens of doctor's office stickers in my center console and I thought it'd be cool to make a poster. That simple idea has been floating around in my mind for YEARS. This year, with my new plan, I decided to make it a line item on my creative IMDB. Boom. Shipped. 


This is harsh, and maybe not needed: 
Good. Scalability can suck it. Every time I'm just about to make progress with something hands-on or creative, I'm barraged with neurotic dread about how it's not scalable because I'll think of a better way to do it tomorrow or next week or next year, and I shouldn't even bother because the circumstances will change or I didn't think of the right scenarios and even if I do make something novel - and that's certainly no guarantee - I won't be able to repeat it. 

For next time - ok, check the run-on notes there to parse where to go next. I think it's coming around.
