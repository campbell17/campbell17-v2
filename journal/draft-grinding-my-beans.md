Every morning I grind 2 tablespoons of coffee beans by spinning a long handle around an aluminum cylinder for 90 seconds. I look ridiculous doing it. It feels longer than 90 seconds. I think it's giving me tendonitis.

There are more efficient ways to grind coffee beans.

Occasionally, I get a little overzealous when I transfer the beans from the tablespoon to the skinny mouth of the cylinder and a few of them escape, temporarily getting a taste of freedom. I have to put everything down, scoot the chair out of the way (being careful not to run over the escapees), decide whether or not to tempt fate by using unclean beans, and plink them back in with their friends.

There are more dignified ways to grind coffee beans.



Sure, one of the reasons I do this is because this old-timey hand crank burr grinder is thirty-five dollars and the least expensive electric counterpart is three times that. 


What is the surprise of this story?
