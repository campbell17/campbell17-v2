Every so often, I tell my youngest son something worth repeating. Most of the words flying out of my mouth are forgettable, which is natural for a likes-the-sound-of-his-own-voice guy like me. If I get to rambling around new people I feel self-conscious soon after. Unless, of course, my rambling led to uproarious laughter, but I'm still waiting for that to ever happen. Anyway, between the obscure movie quotes, belabored lectures, and constant nagging, I can muster up at least one or two nuggets of signal amongst the noise.

The other day, as my son walked out the front door to catch his bus for middle school, a simple concept appeared in my mind. It was a distillation of every feeling I've ever had about why non-stop exposure to screen-based entertainment is unhealthy. I've written about the value of boredom, but never in a way concise enough to impart easily in the form of a passing reminder. I've already yearned for a short, sticky way to sum up the importance of leaving my phone in my pocket.

So as he made his way down the long front yard, across the neighbor's driveway, and settled beside the redwood tree two doors down, I sent him a text with this reminder:

"Some of our best ideas materialize in the few minutes of boredom in between other activities."

When we saturate our attention with...anything, really, we steal an opportunity away from the universe to speak something interesting into our lives.

Remember this.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
