<!-- Postponing this for now. At the time of this writing, I'm lost. I'm going to pick up the thread with my last decent essay (Smooth your jaggies) and write one of the "which one should I do next" essays from the outro. -->

Should be. Should be.

Should be, should be, should be.

What do we do with all the "should's" we put upon ourselves?

- I know I'm in a bad place when I start thinking how things should be instead of how they are. 
- Who the fuck am I that I'm in charge of what should be?
- I'm of the age now where most of my should be's are turning into should have been's. 
- Should be is the calling card of the underperformer. The underachiever. The poseur.
- I should be further along by now. I should be done with that project. I should be past this.
- But compared to what? There is no clone of me out there with no home improvement projects in the hopper or creative pursuits left unfulfilled.
- So what else should I be than what I am right now?
- There is a fire in most of us we can't describe, exactly.
- For some it materializes solely as monetary ambition. Economic libido.
- At least that's simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. Buy anything at a lower price than you sell it for. Repeat.
-  
- 

- I used to have difficulty sleeping. I could never quiet my mind enough to drift off peacefully and every night was a battle of wills against my conscience.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
