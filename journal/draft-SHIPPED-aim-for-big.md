What's the title?

When I was in college I worked at a sporting goods store. It was a standard retail job - help customers, stock the shelves, work the register, and so on - but this company was a bit unique in that it heavily emphasized excellence in customer service. If you've ever been in a mall Foot Locker (or almost any brick & mortar retail store), you may have noticed the absense of helpful, knowledgable staff. There are people who work there, sure, but most of them are just waiting for you to leave so they can go back to gossiping or talking shit about their manager while they refold the shirts you so rudely touched.

My store was not like this. City Sports in Center City Philadelphia in the early 2000's was the place you went when you needed the right thing but you didn't know what that thing was. But we knew. "I need a new pair of running shoes" was our favorite phrase because it meant we could show off our hard-won knowledge about the intricacies of the shoes and how to fit the perfect model. In contrast, "you got them new Jordan's?" made us sad and we took our sadness out on the customers when we told them to try the Foot Locker on Chestnut street.

But this essay is not about comparing the inventory of a high-brow establishment such as ours to that of the workaday Foot Lockers of the world. Rather, it's to examine the perspective required to maintain that high-brow culture.

The shoe wall was at the back of the store. Though placed deep within, past the towering ediface of backpacks, the maze of high-end yoga pants, the smattering of team sports equipment, and the tennis racquet restringing apparatus, the shoe wall was City Sports' defining feature. But being in the city, space was at a premium. So through a door at the left side of the wall lied a long, diamond-plated steel staircase down to the basement where the racks of shoe boxes resembled the warehouse from Raiders of the Lost Ark where "Top...Men..." were looking into the Ark of the Covenant.

Also down there amongst the racks was the manager's office, break room, coat room, two bathrooms, and the punch clock[1]. Every retail store back-room of that era had much the same setup. Except we had something special. A small sign on the wall inside each bathroom. It's hardly fair to call them signs, since they were just two sheets of printer paper with three lines of text in 48 point Arial font. But those three lines are what set us apart.

| Big people talk about ideas.
| Average people talk about things.
| Small people talk about other people.

I was 19 when I started working at City Sports. And when I say I was 19, what I mean is I was oblivious. I probably looked at that sign for months before I actually internalized its meaning. When I did, though, it slapped me awake. It made me realize I hadn't spent even a moment considering my topics of conversation were a reflection of my inner compass. So I flushed the toilet, washed my hands, clocked in, and never stopped thinking about it.

First, I pondered what it meant about the store manager who posted those signs. I realized the culture of excellence the store carried on its back wasn't an accident. It was the result of the high standards set and (perhaps more importantly) enforced by management. As a lazy teenager, I did not care for this. But I didn't want to bear the humiliation of getting shitcanned for my laziness, so I allowed myself, kicking and screaming, to hop on board with the program. Posting those little signs in the bathrooms was a stroke of genius. Remember, this was pre-smart phones. There was nothing else to look at in there. So I kept reading it. And I kept thinking about it.

It forced me to look at how I thought about other people. Because how we think about people is how we talk about them when they're not around. Inherently we know it's wrong to speak ill of other people, but knowing what's wrong is rarely enough to keep us from doing it. But something about the juxtoposition of big people vs. small people crystalized the wrongness in a way that made me want to examine my culpability more closely. I didn't want a permanent seat at the small people table.

However, some of our gossip is ceremonial. When people ask how my loved ones are doing, I don't say, "I make it a point not to talk about other people" because that would signal to the interested party that I'm the kind of person who's never seen the opposite sex naked. Instead, I give them an update - punching up the boring bits and tamping down the humiliations so they don't regret asking - and call it done. Other gossip is recreational. These are usually conversations between friends about the mutual friends who aren't there to defend themselves from ridicule. These are the brutal truths that comedians often dole out to each other as a mark of affinity, explained thusly: "If we didn't like you, we wouldn't be talking about you _at all_".

But the dominant reason why we choose to talk about other people is it's easier. For one thing, we don't have to know the faintest thing about the person we're talking about. All we need is their name and a vague impression of their personality and our imaginations can fill in the blanks to portray their lives and decisions in whatever way suits the conversation. Our social nature as humans makes this effortless, and it's usually the first place we think to go. For things and ideas, we need to know stuff. Or at least be curious about the _possibility_ of knowing stuff.

More than two decades removed from my time at City Sports, I've come to believe our little basement bathroom sign was an aspirational message and not a strict dogma. It's unrealistic to make a mission of avoiding talking about people entirely. Instead, the gift that sign bestowed on us was the motivation to aim higher. Elevating our aim toward crowding out the petty gossip with actual interesting ideas was the real mission, and the real message of that humble piece of printer paper. It gave every employee a jolt of reflection as we climbed the stairs to start our shift, and a lifetime of perspective to take with us.

<!-- Notes for next time: Talk about how innocuous that seemed. Then talk about what it really means. Then talk about how that relates to the way the store was run. Then talk about how that relates to how we think about other people. Then talk about how that affects how we talk about other people when they're not around. Then talk about how worrying about how people talk about us is incorrect, because they aren't hurting us if we're not around to hear it. They're only hurting themselves. And by that token, so are we when we do the same. -->

<!-- Finish first, but - when you're done, update the whole thing to present tense (you might need to add some transition sentences to make it work) to see if it's more interesting that way -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
