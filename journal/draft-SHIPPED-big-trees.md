Through every window in my house, whichever way we look, we see big, beautiful trees. There's a white oak, a black oak, a red oak, a few hickory, two Japanese maples, a smattering of tulip poplars, two pines, and one lonely dogwood. Excluding the maples and the dogwood, every tree is over 80 feet tall. These trees are old.

They were here when my kids were born...when I was born...when my father was born.

Beneath the bark, year after year, they grow new rings, dispassionate about the noise of everyday life.

While we scurry about our busy days, bouncing between the guardrails of ambition and apathy, the old trees stand watch.

But when we pause and gaze skyward into the canopy, we bear witness to the majestic disarray of steady, unstoppable progress. Each branch tip represents a committment to the upward movement of the whole. We see them sway gently to the west as harsh winds blow in, and then release to the east as the winds blow out. Graceful, humble, and unemotional.

These trees are old. They've seen everything there is to see. And despite all the hopes, dreams, fears, and atrocities inhabiting humankind, here they still stand. They made it this far, and they're going to keep going. And if I ever need a reminder when things become too bleak, I need only look up.





Show me a person who hates a big 'ol tree. You can't, can you?

- Our reverence for old trees is universal.
- They watch over us.
- They turn the wind into music (be less pretentious than this).
- They were here when we were born and they'll still be here when we die.

- Staring up into the canopy of a hundred foot tree is akin to star-gazing.
- Little else has the power to so effectively separate ourselves from our hectic lives and inspire awe, humility, and gratitude.
- Nature in general facilitates this well, but there's something in particular about enormous trees.
- I think it's the connection we associate with time and growth.
- When we see a huge tree we know it's old because we know how slow and steady trees grow. (this is derpy)
 
- These trees teach us about time and about change. A maniacal wind hides in plain sight, devouring whatever attention we pay it. But the trees don't hear the scuttle along the ground. And the trees are too steady to let small things break them. They sway to the west when the winds blow in, and back to the east when the winds blow out. Unemotional. Graceful. Humble. No matter what happens in our lives, there they stand, year after year.

<!-- - And what of the geese? The squawky geese. Where I live there are four seasons, so the migrating birds come and go. The most common (and audible) of these are the Canada Geese. It's Canada Geese. Not Canadian Geese. If you say Canadian Geese to me I have no choice but to assume you're trying to wind me up in which case let me put down my Sweet Arnold Palmer so we can fight.
- Anyway (*picks beverage back up, takes delicious victory sip), every year as the weather turns, the distinct collective honking of dozens of geese rings out across the landscape as they make their journey to and from warmer climates. I'm never too busy to stop and look skyward to catch a fleeting glimpse. In the same way the trees inspire awe for their sheer longevity, the geese inspire awareness for the inevitability of change. The geese don't waste energy hoping they don't have to fly south this year. They accept the sacrifice they have to make to stay alive, and they make it every year. -->

<!-- Notes: do I scrap the geese? -->

<!-- Notes for next time: What can we learn from the awe and awareness-inspiring trees 'n geese? -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Truth, create that which will be remembered.
