So what happened in Mexico City? What can we deem remarkable?

- Qualifying was weird. Where did the Ferrari pace come from?
- Checo was in the lead for about 10 meters - when it isn't your year, it isn't your year
- Did the crowd leave after Checo was out?
- Magnussen's car threw him off the track in an old-school way, leading to a red flag
- Max set another record
- Logan had to retire in the last corner, disappointing but he still ran the whole race
- Lando was racing a different category - P17 to P5
- Lewis is excited
- Aston double DNF, data doesn't tell the story (graph comparing Aston to Mclaren points haul ytd, qualifying pre-show?)
- Ricciardo rock solid
- Is Alfa Romeo is the most invisible team of all time?

"Hi. My name is Ferrari."

"Hello, Ferrari." 

"This is my first time sharing in group, so I'm pretty nervous...bear with me."

"Welcome," said the safety car. The other cars silently welcome Ferrari with empathetic smiles.

"Where do I start? For the last two weeks, I feel like we've been right on the edge of a breakthrough. But just when it seems like I have it together, I can't close the deal. I'm just not quick enough."

"Thank you for sharing, Ferrari," said the safety car. "Who else has something to share?"

"Well, I had a painful week," said Haas with a raised hand. "I broke my right-rear suspension and slammed myself hard into the barriers at turn 8."


Nothing sums up Checo's year quite like a first-corner exit. Nothing sums up Checo's year quite like a first-corner exit at his home grand prix. And nothing sums up Checo's year quite like a first-corner exit at his home grand prix after acing the start to go from 5th to 1st by the end of the front straight.

A near carbon copy of Hamilton's blunder in Qatar and with some extra style points for altitude, Sergio Perez sent his overtake into turn one on a line made for the width of two cars. Unfortunately, Perez plus Leclerc plus Verstappen adds up to three, and Checo's race ended faster than it began.

It's tempting to search for a root cause of the disparity between the performance of Sergio and Max this season, especially when we consider how unbeatable their pace is this season. But looking down the grid, we see this phenomenon play out across other teams as well. At Aston Martin, Alonso rose quickly in the points early in the season and his teammate Stroll struggled to answer. Logan Sargeant's well-documented struggles are scrutinized even more severely by comparing them to his teammate Albon who seems to extract more out of the Williams than it deserves. Even at McLaren, where both drivers are soaking in the meteoric rise since their upgrades in Austria, Lando is steadily pulling clear of Oscar Piastri after some truly outstanding drives.

The perception of Perez being the sad sac of the grid reveals itself as even more ridiculous when we consider he's still 2nd in the championship. And if he holds station for the three remaining races this season, he will have helped Red Bull achieve yet another first to go along with their sixth constructors championship: a one-two in the driver's standings. So for anyone considering the notion Red Bull should replace Sergio next season because of how inconsistent he's been this year, remember this: When it comes to the championship points, they don't ask _how_, they ask _how many_.




<!-- Checo goes last -->

The ending is something like the "Beaten-down-by-Max support group"

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
