Montoya's Move
How a promise fulfilled and a forceful overtake something something something

Before I loved F1, I loved Indycar. Back then it was called _CART_[1], which was confusing when trying to explain it to my friends ("You watch go-karts?"). But one driver in particular captured my attention and helped elevate my passion for racing: Juan Montoya.



Talk about who he was, how he raced, his dominance, his attitude, his bright smile and chubby cheeks. (maybe not that far).

Then talk about the move. "And then he left." Writing this now I realize this all falls apart because he left in 2001 and I was a supposed fan in 1999. I gotta figure out how to make the timeline's work here. Maybe talk about how, though I didn't miss a race, I was just as interested in Indycar for those first few years, so I took the time to watch both. But once he moved over, it _was_ over.

Talk about finally having a team to get behind (Williams) and buying my first hat. Haven't bought one since. Don't take that as a rep of my feelings for the sport, more that I'm incredibly cheap and it just proves how fanatical I was about Montoya and Williams.

Talk about the name change. Wait, he's Juan _Pablo_ Montoya now? I guess...I guess that makes sense? Hentz _Harold_ Frentzen, uhhh...who else. Ok, nope, that's weird. Maybe research who decided on the name change?

But then something happened in Brazil. It took only a moment. But it signified to me with a big red siren that I backed the correct horse. (draw this part out if you can, do some embellishment)

Describe the significance of the move. Describe how no one on the grid was challenging Michael. Talk about his pace. Talk about the setup. Then, the move. For the lead. And then he disappeared.

Then maybe talk about how I knew the Verstappen name long before Max started racing. Because his dad ruined what would have been the perfect day for Montoya by using him as a launch pad in the braking zone as they approached (name of turn).

But that almost didn't matter. Everyone knew what they saw. The arrival. And I my love for 2 single seater series was reduced to 1.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
