I'm entering dangerous territory. I'm noticing things lately. When I notice things I feel compelled to do something about them. The things I'm noticing lately involve reading and writing. More to the point, the things I'm noticing lately involve _my_ reading and writing. Before, those hobbies were like two ships passing in the night. A few nights ago while doing some bedtime reading, those ships collided.

As recently as last week, reading a book meant I submitted my attention to the subject of the writing - _what_ the author was writing about. This straightforward reading policy has served me adequately up to this point. But writing every day surfaced some second-order effects to the way I read. Now I'm consciously aware of _how_ the author writes. I may have simultaneously ruined two hobbies. Reading is ruined because now I'm compelled to alternate between audience member and note-taker. Unfettered enjoyment is off the table. And writing is ruined because while I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, I more clearly see the cavernous divide between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading.


I've come across this before, this "discovery of the previously unseen". This isn't the first time I've had epiphanies like this, but usually they're in a passive context where I have no plans to gain proficiency in the subject matter. Some of the deepest internet vortexes(1) I've encountered are the result of unearthing levels of skill I didn't think possible. [In my last essay] I mentioned my habitual overuse of YouTube last year. An overwhelming percentage of watch time was dedicated to observing artists, woodworkers, machinists, homebuilders, and musicians showcasing their skills and expertise. However, my cursory understanding of their work is so far removed from how I spend my own time, the viewing experience is like a vignette or a play. I'm interested as an audience member, but my conscious mind isn't trying to crack open the shell to dissect how they do what they do. I'm looking for stimulation and entertainment, not ideas and insights.

This is not passive. 

This is written badly - update it: When I realized I started noticing the way things were written, I got scared. Something was changing and change is uncomfortable. I was scared I wouldn't be able to enjoy reading for the pleasure of it. I was scared the benefits of this new discovery wouldn't outweight the drawbacks, whatever those are. I was scared about complicating my life with new detail. I was scared of the world map continuing to expand, and I would come to understand all the new things I didn't know. 

Gaining proficiency in any area involves three stages. Initially, you have zero clue so progress is slow and resembles fishing around in the kitchen junk drawer in total darkness. In some cases you can't even remember what you're fishing for or why you even entered the kitchen in the first place. Stage two starts when you figure those things out and start making progress hand over fist. Finally, at some point hundreds if not thousands of hours into stage two, the rate of improvement tapers off and you're free to spend the rest of eternity chasing mastery.

As fun as it is to inhabit level two, it's difficult to determine how high up the mountain I am. Whenever I apex a crest I'm faced not with a beautiful expanse of land as I peer out from the top, but with a short passage leading to the base of the next climb...


Not sure if this will make the cut:
It reminds me of playing an open-world game for the first time. I go through the tutorial to learn a bit of gameplay, then unlock the world map. Naively I think, "Wow, that's a lot of ground to cover. This is going to take forever." Cruelly, this is just a _piece_ of the map. A few missions in, I unlock the rest and the shit hits the fan. At this moment my brain processes a distinct loss of innocence and teleports me to a fork in the road. To the left, panic. To the right, pain.



(1) Urban Dictionary describes this as finding something interesting on the internet and then something else until you discover you wasted the whole day. In my example, the "something else" is simply a deeper level of the same subject.

Notes for next time: Check flow:
1. Discovery
2. Then vs. Now, post discovery
3. This discovery is a pattern, but is usually passive a observed from a safe distance
4. This particular discovery is NOT passive.
5. Fears associated with non-passive discoveries
6. How the feats fit in to the learning curveâ„¢
7. Where I am on the curve
8. The uncertainty of the mountain
9. The call to adventure
10. Looking back on the progress makes it worth it and easier to decide to take on the call next time. It's always the correct decision as long as it's based in truth.

Talk about how each time I start climbing the next little hill, I notice more things I didn't know. But in the end, I can't give a shit about all that because I know at some point when I peek behind me, there's a wake of contributions to the world with my stamp on them that never would have existed if I decided to sit on my ass. So I didn't ruin two hobbies, I supercharged them.






Note: the point is as follows - For the first time, I'm not only considering the subject matter of the writing, but the manner in which it is written. I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, but only now in the context of writing every day do I see how that "noticing" applies to me. I can't unsee that. I see clear as day the cavernous canyon between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading. Now what? Do I continue to wallow in the sewers where my current skills reside? Or do I take on this new suffering and bear it, embarking on a journey out of the darkness?

Note for visual aids / metaphor: this discovery is similar to the worldmap in an open-world game. You enter knowing almost nothing, and you think "wow that's a big area to cover" when you see the map. Then you complete a few missions and the rest of the map opens and now the veil is lifted. Now you can see with your own eyes that you didn't know anything. And who's to say that won't happen again in exactly the same way once you complete THAT map. Spoiler alert. It will. Other examples include Clickspring for detail-oriented precision machining, Frank howarth for process filmmaking, woodworking, etc. Kim Jung Gi for ink drawing. Mike Dawes for fingerstyle guitar. Paradigm-shifting discoveries. Oh THIS IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE??? (Stuff on computer desk flipping meme - flip, flip, flip, flip, throws hands up)
