I'm entering dangerous territory. I'm noticing things. When you notice things-if you have any sense-you feel compelled to do something about them. I enjoy reading books and writing thoughts. In all my years on this good earth, the particulars of those hobbies acted like two ships passing in the night. A few nights ago while doing some bedtime reading, all that changed.

At first I felt charmed by my little discovery. Oh, isn't that interesting, I thought. But I moved on, not yet realizing I was about to know my true nakedness. Then last night, it happened again. Now, it's settled. I'm hosed.

As recently as last week, reading a book meant I submitted my attention to subject of the writing. _What_ is the author showing me? This straightforward reading policy served me adequately my whole life. Now, however, I'm just as interested in _how_ the author shows me. I may have simultaneously ruined two hobbies. Reading is ruined because now I'm compelled to alternate between audience member and note-taker so unfettered enjoyment is off the table. And writing is ruined because while I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, now that I'm writing every day I see the cavernous divide between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading.

It reminds me of playing an open-world game for the first time. You go through the tutorial to learn a bit of gameplay, then you unlock the world map. Sometimes, depending on the game, you're limited just a piece of the map, but you don't know that at the time. You think, "wow, that's a lot of ground to cover. This is going to take forever." Then, a few missions in, you unlock the rest of the map. This moment - the instant your brain processes that you just lost your innocence - immediately places you at a fork in the road. You think this is too much. You already thought the world was too big, and this is immeasurably bigger. You can't do this.

This isn't the first time I've had epiphanies like this, but usually they're in a passive context where I have no plans to gain proficiency in the subject matter. Some of the deepest internet vortexes(1) I've encountered are the result of unearthing levels of skill I didn't think possible. [In my last essay] I mentioned my habitual overuse of YouTube last year. An overwhelming percentage of watch time was dedicated to observing artists, woodworkers, machinists, homebuilders, and musicians showcasing their skills and expertise. However, my cursory understanding of their work is so far removed from how I spend my own time, the viewing experience is like a vignette or a play. I'm an interested audience member, but my conscious mind isn't trying to crack open the shell to dissect how they do what they do. I'm looking for stimulation and entertainment to improve my mood, not ideas and insights to improve my skills.


(1) Urban Dictionary describes this as finding something interesting on the internet and then something else until you discover you wasted the whole day. In my example, the "something else" is simply a deeper level of the same subject.

Note for next time: Show what happens when you peek over the summit only to find a higher summit as it relates to skill-building. Show the looping gif of the aerial map shrinking, but in reverse so it's infinitely expanding. Introduce some notes about the zone of suck from AvE's learning curve explanation. 

Note: the point is as follows - For the first time, I'm not only considering the subject matter of the writing, but the manner in which it is written. I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, but only now in the context of writing every day do I see how that "noticing" applies to me. I can't unsee that. I see clear as day the cavernous canyon between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading. Now what? Do I continue to wallow in the sewers where my current skills reside? Or do I take on this new suffering and bear it, embarking on a journey out of the darkness?

Note for visual aids / metaphor: this discovery is similar to the worldmap in an open-world game. You enter knowing almost nothing, and you think "wow that's a big area to cover" when you see the map. Then you complete a few missions and the rest of the map opens and now the veil is lifted. Now you can see with your own eyes that you didn't know anything. And who's to say that won't happen again in exactly the same way once you complete THAT map. Spoiler alert. It will. Other examples include Clickspring for detail-oriented precision machining, Frank howarth for process filmmaking, woodworking, etc. Kim Jung Gi for ink drawing. Mike Dawes for fingerstyle guitar. Paradigm-shifting discoveries. Oh THIS IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE??? (Stuff on computer desk flipping meme - flip, flip, flip, flip, throws hands up)
