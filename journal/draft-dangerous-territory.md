I'm entering dangerous territory. I'm noticing things. When you notice things-if you have any sense-you feel compelled to do something about them. I enjoy reading books and writing thoughts. In all my years on this good earth, the particulars of those hobbies acted like two ships passing in the night. A few nights ago while doing some bedtime reading, all that changed.

At first I felt charmed by my little discovery. Oh, isn't that interesting, I thought. But I moved on, not yet realizing I was about to know my true nakedness. Then last night, it happened again. Now, it's settled. I'm hosed.

As recently as last week, reading a book meant I submitted my attention to subject of the writing. _What_ is the author showing me? This straightforward reading policy served me adequately my whole life. Now, however, I'm just as interested in _how_ the author shows me. I may have simultaneously ruined two hobbies. Reading is ruined because now I'm compelled to alternate between audience member and note-taker. Unfettered enjoyment is off the table. And writing is ruined because while I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, writing every day exposes me to the cavernous divide between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading.

It reminds me of playing an open-world game for the first time. I go through the tutorial to learn a bit of gameplay, then unlock the world map. Naively I think, "Wow, that's a lot of ground to cover. This is going to take forever." Cruelly, this is just a _piece_ of the map. A few missions in, I unlock the rest and the shit hits the fan. At this moment my brain processes a distinct loss of innocence and teleports me to a fork in the road. To the left, panic. To the right, pain.



This isn't the first time I've had epiphanies like this, but usually they're in a passive context where I have no plans to gain proficiency in the subject matter. Some of the deepest internet vortexes(1) I've encountered are the result of unearthing levels of skill I didn't think possible. [In my last essay] I mentioned my habitual overuse of YouTube last year. An overwhelming percentage of watch time was dedicated to observing artists, woodworkers, machinists, homebuilders, and musicians showcasing their skills and expertise. However, my cursory understanding of their work is so far removed from how I spend my own time, the viewing experience is like a vignette or a play. I'm interested as an audience member, but my conscious mind isn't trying to crack open the shell to dissect how they do what they do. I'm looking for stimulation and entertainment, not ideas and insights.

Gaining proficiency in any area involves three stages. Initially, you have zero clue so progress is slow and resembles fishing around in the kitchen junk drawer in total darkness. In some cases you can't even remember what you're fishing for or why you even entered the kitchen in the first place. Level two starts when you figure those things out and start making progress hand over fist. At some point, hundreds if not thousands of hours into level two, the rate of improvement tapers off and you're free to spend the rest of eternity chasing pure mastery.

As fun as it is to inhabit level two, it's tough figuring out how high up the mountain I've climbed. When I reach the apex of a crest, instead of seeing the horizon I see the foot of the next hill. 

(1) Urban Dictionary describes this as finding something interesting on the internet and then something else until you discover you wasted the whole day. In my example, the "something else" is simply a deeper level of the same subject.

Note for next time: Talk about how each time I start climbing the next little hill, I notice more things I didn't know. But in the end, I can't give a shit about all that because I know at some point when I peek behind me, there's a wake of contributions to the world with my stamp on them that never would have existed if I decided to sit on my ass. So I didn't ruin two hobbies, I supercharged them.






Note: the point is as follows - For the first time, I'm not only considering the subject matter of the writing, but the manner in which it is written. I've noticed a well-turned phrase before, but only now in the context of writing every day do I see how that "noticing" applies to me. I can't unsee that. I see clear as day the cavernous canyon between my skills and those of the authors' I'm reading. Now what? Do I continue to wallow in the sewers where my current skills reside? Or do I take on this new suffering and bear it, embarking on a journey out of the darkness?

Note for visual aids / metaphor: this discovery is similar to the worldmap in an open-world game. You enter knowing almost nothing, and you think "wow that's a big area to cover" when you see the map. Then you complete a few missions and the rest of the map opens and now the veil is lifted. Now you can see with your own eyes that you didn't know anything. And who's to say that won't happen again in exactly the same way once you complete THAT map. Spoiler alert. It will. Other examples include Clickspring for detail-oriented precision machining, Frank howarth for process filmmaking, woodworking, etc. Kim Jung Gi for ink drawing. Mike Dawes for fingerstyle guitar. Paradigm-shifting discoveries. Oh THIS IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE??? (Stuff on computer desk flipping meme - flip, flip, flip, flip, throws hands up)
