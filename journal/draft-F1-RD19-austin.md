You don't boo excellence.

I never understood this. I'll never understand this. Max takes his 50th win, putting him on the Mt. Rushmore of 50+ gp winners. And the chicken shit fans in Austin boo him on the podium. When you go to a sporting event and your team is performing like amateurs, you boo. When you go to a game and see the rival team's players coming out of the tunnel to take the field, you boo. When you go to a game and the referee makes a terrible call, you boo. When don't you boo? When someone achieves something extraordinary. 

I understand people have opinions. But expressing them like that in public is classless. So instead of Remarkable RD 19, I'm dubbing this UnRemarkable RD 19. So dumb.

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
