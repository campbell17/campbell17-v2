The Magic Touch

| Sometimes, magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect. -Teller

I have this camera. It's a Canon 7D. Released in 2009, the 7D was marketed as a semi-professional DSLR camera with an 18 megapixel sensor and Full HD (1080p) video capabilities. I bought mine in 2011 and mostly used it to shoot home movies. Today, 12 years and 9 months later, it obediently sits on a tripod all day broadcasting my face across the internet for Zoom calls. There's a hint of overkill that surrounds the idea of asking a $1699 camera to do a job a $25 webcam from Amazon can do. But I didn't buy for this. For years it's been sitting in my camera case in suspended animation. I'd stopped shooting home movies and my iPhone is good enough for the vacation pictures I'll never look at again, so by utilizing my fancypants DLSR as a webcam, I turned something I wasn't using into something I was. But there's a catch.

It's old, by technology standards. So getting it to play nice as a webcam, a purpose for which is was not designed, takes some modifications and a deft touch.

The modifications seem straightforward: buy an AC adapter so it doesn't have to run on a battery and set the Auto Power Off function to "Off" in the camera settings. Well...

After _some_ number of minutes, the camera turns off anyway. The maximum setting in the menu is 30 minutes, which is too short for most meetings. A customary browse of the internet reveals others with this same problem, but no useful solution materializes. Dead in the water already. Here's where my brain goes next: "It's supposed to work. So it must work. Let's see how exact this Auto Off thing is." A test is needed. The smallest thing first. Let's set it for 1 minute and see if it actually shuts itself off. A minute passes. Then two minutes. Then five. While it runs in the background, I keep working and forget about it. When I check it again in an hour, my face is still staring back at me in my Zoom call.

It works when Auto Off is set to 1 minute. This makes no sense, but I don't question these things. This is a technological "gift horse".

The next hurdle is actually the first hurdle. Getting my mug to stare back at me in the first place. There's a camera, a computer, and a USB cable. On the camera, there is a USB port into which one side of the cable plugs. On the computer, the same. A reasonable person would assume once both ends are plugged in and the camera is turned ON (don't forget _that_ part), their face would appear on the screen in their video-meeting-software of choice. I always begin as a reasonable person. When this doesn't happen, however, a random sequence of activities commence as part of a troubleshooting algorithm I've unconsciously honed over the decades. Turn it off and back on. Wait. Unplug it and plug it back in. Wait. Turn it off and back on again. Wait. Unplug the other side and plug it back in. Wait. Turn it off and back on again. 

*CLICK!

The loud sound of the camera shutter opening tells me something I did worked. "It's supposed to work. So it must work." The fidelity of what worked is very low, however. All I know to do at this point is pull plugs and cycle the power until it works. There's no indication of how many times, which end of the cable, or how long to wait in between actions. But I got it to work. I hold out hope that the next time I try to use it I can just turn it on as I normally would. But if it decides not to work again, I have this obtuse starting method as a backup.

Things go along fine for the next few months. Sometimes it works. Other times I have to fiddle until it works, but it doesn't take too long. But then something happened. I updated some software. Now it doesn't want to work.

"It's supposed to work. So it must work."

Knowing how I breathed life into the camera before, I can narrow my focus to other things. Maybe the display on top of the camera shows something telling about what the device is thinking when I cycle its power. Maybe the battery door, which has to be closed firmly for the AC to work, loosened over time. Maybe I need to leave the webcam software open at all times now, whereas before I could get the camera working without it.

I look closely at the display.

The final form of my previously successful sequence of actions was to feverishly cycle the power over and over, then turn it off and wait a few seconds, then turn it back on. If that didn't work, I would repeat the process until it did. No more unplugging needed. But I never looked at the diplay while I was doing this. The camera is positioned just behind and blow a mounted monitor, so I have to reach under the monitor and crane my hand back up to reach the power switch. I can't see the display without coming out of my chair and peering around the side of the monitor. Now, as I hunch over in an awkward crouch and cycle the power while looking at the display, I notice the information doesn't always show. Sometimes when the power comes on nothing happens. Other times when the power comes on, the information shows and then immediately disappears. This must have been what was happening when I was doing this blind. When the camera finally turned on, it must have been one of the times the information stayed on screen, meaning the camera was operating properly.

But it gets worse.

I'm skipping ahead to present day, several iterations past the sequence of events I just described. I was correct to focus on the display. There are no fewer than six unique ways the information on the display behaves when the power is turned off and back on. Only two of these ways have a hope of providing functionality to the camera, and this was also only after discovering I had to close the webcam software first, then cycle the power, then open the webcam software once the display was on. I did all this via trial and error. 1 way requires me to open the battery door, pop the battery out and back in, and close the battery door. _Sometimes_ that works. When it doesn't, and the display still won't illuminate, I have to reach all the way under the desk and unplug the power from its source, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in. Then repeat the battery dance, and then it powers up. But that just puts me back to square one where I have to cycle the power until I get one of the two approved sequences.

On my death bed I will ask myself many things. This behavior will rank high on that list. I've been told I have the magic touch when it comes to getting finicky electronics, software, hardware, and other appliances to work. But I don't think it's magic. Over the years, I've simply spent more time finding ways to get things that are supposed to work working than anyone else might reasonably expect.

What can I say? It's supposed to work. 

So it must work.




When we can't get something working, how many times do we retry before we give up?

Something else to think about: if I wasn't using these steps every day, would I remember what to do? Think about Skaffold. Gotta AWS, gotta SSO, gotta Rancher, gotta create world, gotta skaffold dev. Sometimes gotta chaos. Sometimes gotta update shell.



<!-- Notes: This is about failure tolerance. How tuned into something we can get so we still learn enough to make progress after hitting a wall. [Camera story goes here - I have a older-model DSLR on a tripod I use as my webcam for Zoom calls. (write this better) The software it needs for my macbook to recognize it is fiddly. I have to do a 6 part dance sometimes to get it to turn on. Here's what that looks like. Normal people would just buy a $30 webcam on amazon, Not Biff. etc etc] 

Think of the most amazing card trick you've ever seen. Magicians are banking on our inability to fathom the time spent on a single trick. Rather, the amount of times failed before success. (And that's only half their battle - then they have to rehearse the successes often enough to become as second nature as breathing). They're the most elite failure tolerators (obviously, improve this) in the world. -->

<!-- What would you do? 

Ask your handy brother-in-law? Take it to the shop or, if you like overpaying, the dealer? Not Biff.

In (Back to the Future)[] when Biff's car wouldn't start, he fiddled and fiddled and fiddled until he cracked the secret code - the finicky, obtuse, and seemingly unrelated series of actions only Biff knew how to execute to reliably start his Ford Super De Luxe Convertible. Now Biff doesn't even need to lock the doors.-->  
<-- /This is wrong - he had a button on the dashboard according to nerds on the internet.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme.

<!-- Candidate note -->
- Steve Douglas-Craig wrote romantic comedies in college, but would never be caught dead seeing one in the theater. Horror/Thriller is his genre. The dean asked him why he would write movies he would never see. Note: Write the story you would not be able to put down.
