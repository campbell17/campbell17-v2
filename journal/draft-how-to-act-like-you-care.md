Years ago I was watching a scene from Louis CK's Epix series "Louis", when a particular scene with Matthew Broderick caught my attention...

for next time: describe the scene briefly - decide whether or not to reveal that scene's punchline as the surprise, or keep it in the intro and level a different surprise later.

What is the surprise of this story?
