<!-- Need an intro? -->

The way the thousands of people who work in F1 keep perspective about their progress is remarkable. There’s a palpable appreciation for small victories in F1. When you watch a race and listen to the drivers over the radio on the cooldown lap, nearly everyone is happy. Up and down the grid, most of the communication is congratulatory, gracious, and grateful. Even the bitter disappointments contain such a sense of we'll-get-em-next-time spirit, I can all but feel the empathetic pats on the back in the voices of the race engineers. Only with proper perspective is this possible. 

One of the things I first noticed about F1 was the exclusivity of the points scoring. When I first became a fan, out of the twenty drivers competing, only six got points. At first I didn't believe it and had to look more closely. "That can't be right..." They've since increased the amount twice, to eight drivers in 2003, and again in 2010 to the current number of ten drivers. Even so, half the grid are still resigned to the fact that they'll make no progress at all in the championship. But this limitation is one of the foundations of how drivers and teams think and talk about their performance.

When points are this rare, achieving _any_ points-paying position is an accomplishment, and the attitude toward those small "wins" reflects that. Compare this to other race series where points are awarded even to last place, and the focus shifts to only celebrating the winner. This is the critical difference between F1 and others, and it’s one of the things that most attracts me to its culture.

The podium ceremony celebrates not one winner, but four special individuals: the winning driver, a representitive from the winning team, and the second & third place finishers. All four are presented with trophies, and the winning team and driver get the additional honor of standing tall for their national anthems.

Obviously, the objective for every driver is to win the race. But despite the elite skills of the drivers, mechanics, strategists, and everyone else in the paddock and at the factory, there's an immense aura of humility and pragmatism on display after all the cars take the chequered flag. When asked to assess their performance, members of the teams base their answers on the delta between their results and their calculated, realistic pre-race expectations. Midfield teams with smaller budgets and fewer personnel _know_ they're midfield teams and are unapologetic about their excitement over scoring even one championship point. That excitement is real. It illustrates the best way to not only survive but to thrive despite the brutal mental toll this sport takes is to constantly calibrate your perspective.

So why race if you know you can't win? Because most people will never win. Most things follow a [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), where the large portion of success (the 80%) is held by a small fraction of the population (the 20%). So when faced with this, the way to derive meaning from anything we do is to try our absolute hardest and see what happens. And the point of any game we play in our lives is not necessarily to win _every_ time. The way you make the game meaningful is to assemble whatever conditions you need to _continue playing_. This will make it so there's always something worth reaching for just beyond the edges of your fingertips.

The point of racing is to compete. Winning is only a potential byproduct of that competition. Once all the cars cross the line, reality steps out of the shadows and every member of every team must recognize who they really are and adjust their expectations and objectives accordingly.

So despite being an incredibly glamorous and romantic sport, one of the things I love most about F1 is how _unromantic_ everyone remains about their progress. They celebrate the small wins, knowing the best way to make huge gains is to start by making small ones. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time:

| I'd say it was a pretty good day today, we finished in front of the team we're chasing in the championship, so even though we weren't in the points, we met our target...
| It feels fantastic to get some points today, especially in front of my home crowd. Hopefully we can keep this up in the next race...
| We were happy with 5th - I think that's the best we could get out of the car, so we maximized our potential today...
| It's incredible to be up here on the podium, I'm so happy for the team and everyone back at the factory, they've been working so hard...
| This win has been a long time coming...thanks to all the fans and everyone out there supporting us, and all the hard work from the team. They deserve it.

This isn't to say that the sport lacks disappointment. It's _is_ a competition, so naturally the climb of some teams is at the direct expense their rivals. But with every new Grand Prix, the optimism and hope returns, and the opportunity to get just a little better presents itself. They know where they stand. They understand the big picture and what's at stake. All that's left to do is go out there and try to get it.



<!-- These don't really work as endings for this: -->
The key to improving at something is to first get good at knowing ourselves. Knowing what we are and where we stand. And we only achieve this by being honest about it. The teams in F1 are lucky. They have the S-tier truth serum: the stopwatch. Amongst all the crowd noise, peanut-gallery predictions, sandbagging, and grandstanding, the only thing that counts is the time on the watch. 

For me, Formula One is a constant reminder of the importance of balance. If you don't push at all, you never get a chance to move up. But if you push too hard, you risk going over the limit and ending up in the wall. 

<!-- NOTE: I think I need to scrap this, too: And when you watch the podium ceremony...I’m sorry, let me back up. They actually _have_ a podium ceremony. The top **three** drivers are awarded trophies, the winner gets to hear his national anthem, the team theirs, and we get to witness it all without such as a mousefart from the commentators.  -->

<!-- NOTE: try to write this sans comparisons to other sports: It's difficult to avoid apples & oranges arguments when comparing Indycar to F1... -->
Here's one casualty: In most other sports, even those with long-term points-based championships, if the win escapes them they act as though the only reasonable option is euthanasia.

<!-- Unnecessary intro: -->
Is it the media coverage?

Is it the culture?

Maybe there's something in the water.


Notes2: How do I present the content of the subtitle without using Indycar as a strawman? I need to stay focused on the remarkable nature of the culture, but how to show that uniqueness without a direct comparison? That's the challenge. 
- The podium is 3 drivers and a team member. Special attention is paid to the trophies (and now medal for the winner), and a different person receives the honor of presenting each trophy. The team's also hand-pick who represents them as the constructors trophy recipient, and it changes with every win. 
- The post race rituals are mandated by the FIA and performed to the letter. Each driver must weigh in, the podium finishers get a few moments to celebrate with their team, then they go to a cooldown room to hydrate and compose themselves. The TV coverage of this, by the way, is a fairly recent addition and deserves its own essay. It's one of my favorite things to witness during the race weekend.
- Some of these notes are notes for other essays, as it turns out. I'll have to draw focus back into the incremental progress and how everyone talks about it with positivity. 

Notes for next time: More on knowing themselves, the progress, and the overall perspective.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
