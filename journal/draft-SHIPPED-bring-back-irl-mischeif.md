- Kicking over trash cans and opening mail boxes
    - Compare to modern "wrongdoing"...it's easy to spot a trash can askew, but what if the kids are shitposting online?

When I was bike riding age, my friend and I decided it'd be fun to ride around the neighborhood kicking over people's trash cans and opening their mail boxes. A reasonable assumption for a kid in elementary school, I think...

Notes: This is a story about doing fun things that are wrong, and how the challenge of spotting these events from a parents' perspective has changed for this generation of online-only kids.


Have you ever done something fun that was objectively wrong? Of course you have. We all have. The human condition encourages this. Because one of the fundamental building blocks of fun is risk, and what could be more risky than doing something you know is wrong and hoping you get away with it? However, it's the separation of risk from wrongdoing that determines how sustainable our fun is. Sports like skiing are risky because they're physically dangerous, which for some people adds to the fun. For them, the fun increases as the risk does, as long as they don't overdo it. So far, it's risky without being wrong. But what if every time I finished my ski run I snow-showered all the people in the lift line as I stopped? I can see how that would be fun if we were all friends and that was our thing, but if I did that to an unsuspecting cloister of small children, I'd be perma-banned from the resort. 

When we go ice skating, my youngest son always asks me to do a hot lap while he takes a seat on the bench and waits for me to hockey-stop into the open door, painting him with snow. The other parents are always horrified until he giggles and commands me to do it again. Even with his blessing, some might see this as the wrong and it probably is. If the rink staff has to ask me to stop and I just apologize and don't protest, it's because I already know it's wrong. For the record, I've never been asked to stop.

Once when I was riding bikes with a friend, we decided to have some extra fun. It was trash day, a concept I didn't yet know existed, and the empty cans of everyone in the neighborhood were still loitering at the end of their driveways. We thought it would be fun to strafe these poor defenseless bins, kicking them to the pavement as we coasted by on our bikes. They crashed and bounced to the ground with an echoing boom. It was such a satisfying sound, we did the whole street. Halfway through, we added a twist. Let's open all these mailboxes, too. On we went, open-kick, pedal pedal, kick-open, pedal pedal, kick-kick-open (this family had two cans)...

Word got back to Mom, and she reintroduced me to the idea of the golden rule (and the back of her hand). I forgot to consider what it would feel if someone kicked something of mine that wasn't supposed to be kicked. Lesson learned, when it comes to other people and their stuff, it's risky _because_ it's wrong.

In life before the internet, wrongdoing as a recreational activity was primarily confined to that which could be seen by any interested onlooker. Prank phone calls aside, no mischief was possible without paying the "is anybody looking" tax. The specter of a human being seeing us do something wrong, on purpose and in person, was a natural barrier to entry in the playful-vandalism game. This makes the modern would-be can-kickers three times more vulnerable to mischief's allure. First, there's the inherent anonymity of the internet, shielding us from accountability. Then, there's the access. The phones in our pockets mean not only do we not have to leave the house, but we can shitpost our angst upon unsuspecting strangers from the comfort of the spare bathroom. Finally, recourse from even the most attentive (and technically talented) parents is rare, since there are no neighbors watching over our shoulder as we get ourselves into trouble online.

It's no wonder there seems to be an overabundance of kids with fully-scheduled calendars and not a moment to themselves. I don't know what the answer is, but I'll always yearn for the times when all the neighborhood parents sent their kids outside to play together and had to tell them to be back by dinner. Right. I'm officially out of touch.




I _am_ technically talented, and locking down my son's phone was still fiddly and frought with trial and error. Also, _his friends all have phones_. Short of starting a neighborhood parenting club where we all agree to the same level of psychopathic ankle-braceleting of our kids' devices, we're powerless to see let alone stop a pattern of rogue behavior before it becomes their default.







(where I'm going with this is, putting other people out can also be fun, but if it isn't their idea/they're not part of it, it's wrong.) 



Notes: After you explain this better, move on to "This one time at band camp" and tell the story about the cans and boxes. Then compare the obviousness of that being wrong with the obfuscation of the wrongness of certain social media habits? Let's see where that goes.



DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
