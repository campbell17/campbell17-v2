I was tempted to write about track limits this week. Then, poor Logan Sargeant had to retire from the race with what turned out to be extreme dehydration. I considered adopting that as the most notable moment. I've seen drivers fail to start due to illness, but never have I seen one retire from a race before the end. I was hesitant to write about Logan struggling again, but when I watched the onboard footage from some of the other drivers struggling to extract themselves from their cars at the end of the race, I realized I wouldn't have to. This is bigger than one driver.

Stroll, stumbling into the medical van, then disappearing behind it as moments later members of his team rushed over.

Turns out everyone wrote about this.


DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
