Last night, just before dinner, I'm laid out. Looking up at a plastic shroud six inches from my face I'm pondering why I don't jack up the car higher. The oil filter is on too tight so I can't turn it by hand, and the steel cap I bought to loosen a too-tight oil filter fits too flush to get the ratched stub in its hole, and too loosely if I put it on the ratchet prior to cupping it over the filter. This is like a cruel, sadistic game of whack-a-mole. It's unclear how the filter got screwed on so tightly in the first place, but now I'm playing chicken with the half-in ratchet nubbin. I'm desperately trying to apply rotational force to something that doesn't want to be removed while quaking in anticipation of the inevitable moment when the ratchet violently slips out of the cap and I obliterate my knuckles on the car's undersidey parts. 

The faint smell of rosemary through the door to the kitchen tells me I'm running out of time.

"Dad, I got it."

Wait, what am I doing? I inchworm out from under my son's car, put the ratchet in his outstretched hand, and go back inside to finish setting the table.

_The urge to be helpful robs my loved ones of their autonomy_, chapter 516. 

As a child of the 80's, my parents seldom knew what I was up to. It's strange, then, that as a parent I regularly attach myself to the activities and struggles of my children. My son knows how to change his oil. He's no mechanic, but he's done it a few times before and his car has yet to explode on the way to Chipotle.

So why am I squashed under **his** car that **he** didn't jack up high enough, peering out at his impatiently tapping foot?

The answer is a mix of genuinely wanting to help and a deep aversion to mistakes.

WIP *To be continued - the "surprise" is that it's not my car, it's Tristens, and it's hard not to insert myself into their activities. So after I write about the minutiae of changing the oil and things like it (don't go on for too long), do the reveal and then change the subject to said insertion. eww. (Maybe look at the through-line of Van's Details video to see if I can work the departure/return concept in)
