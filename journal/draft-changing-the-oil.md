Last night, just before dinner, I'm laid out. Looking up at a plastic shroud six inches from my face I'm pondering why I don't jack the car up more. The oil filter is on too tight so I can't turn it by hand, and the steel cap I bought to loosen a too-tight oil filter fits too tightly to get the ratched stub in its hole, and too loosely when I put the ratchet stub in prior to affixing it to the filter. 

WIP *To be continued - the "surprise" is that it's not my car, it's Tristens, and it's hard not to insert myself into their activities. So after I write about the minutiae of changing the oil and things like it (don't go on for too long), do the reveal and then change the subject to said insertion. eww. (Maybe look at the through-line of Van's Details video to see if I can work the departure/return concept in)
