I've been waiting for this. The lull. The rut. The change from something that comes easily to something that seems impossible. One of my cardinal principles is at its redline, waiting for just the right conditions to fall apart. The Big Plateau.

That principle, the one I've thought about dozens of times but never written down, is something I used to break consistently when I wrote. That's how it became a principle in the first place. Disgusted with myself, I vowed not to repeat the same behavior. This is not the first time a principle of mine entered the world this way.

Twice I took a stab at football when I was a kid. Once in elementary school, and again in middle school. I remember two things about playing football: I was terrified of making a mistake (and being subsequently yelled at by the coaching staff), and I got hurt all the time. By hurt, I don't mean broken and unable to play, rather the pain inflicted by the sport was higher than my tolerance levels, so I would rather lie on the field and writhe than get back in there and do it again. I spent a good part of my football career writhing on fields, the coaches and other players staring down at me wondering if this time I meant it. I never did. Even when I thought I meant it, my brain was simply refusing to accept that this amount of pain was a normal part of the game.

We were a small group and despite my verbal protests, I was selected for the all star team. This meant I got to participate in a separate series of practices with stronger, faster, and bigger players to prepare for the all star game. At the first practice, as I looked around at the 8th graders who'd already started shaving, I knew I couldn't hack it. I went through the motions of the drills, doing my best to at least look like I was into it, but I couldn't bring myself to believe I belonged there. Then, it was time for the corner drill.

The setup is simple. Two players. One ball. One cone. The players face each other, 20 yards apart. The cone is placed in the middle, but offset to the side by 10 yards. The goal: on the whistle, sprint to the cone and then turn up field. The defender's job is to bring the ball carrier down. The ball carrier's job is to break the tackle and keep running. I'm the defender. As I wait for the whistle, it doesn't escape me that the ball carrier is the apex predator of this all star team. Minutes earlier, he smoked everyone so badly in the 100 yard dash, everyone else on the team had to take a lap for being so slow by comparison. Now it was my job to get him on the ground.

The whistle blows. We both take off.

Four seconds later as I writhed on the ground, surrounded by my teammates and coaches, the following thought floated through my mind: "Oh, _this_ is what it's like to get hurt."

But I was wrong, yet again. All I got was a stinger in my shoulder. A stinger is what they call the searing pain and tingling caused by the sudden overextension of your head from one of your shoulders, as often happens when making a tackle. Your head moves aside to engage your shoulder with the ball carrier and when contact is made, your shoulder dips even further while your head stretches aside even more. This is so common in football, players routinely shake it off and don't even miss a play. Not me, though. With one swift corner drill, our stubbled stud put me out permanently. I still attended practices to show my support, and took the field with the team in street clothes to be recognized as an all star, but in my heart I knew I had no business being on that field. I didn't love the game like these guys. For me it wasn't so much a fun sport as it was an exercise in survival.

Two things are true about that experience, but they live in conflict. I took the cowards way out. I embelleshed my injury to keep me off the field because I felt like a boy in a man's game. One of my teammates who also made the all star team was a true player. He was even smaller than I was, but he was tough as nails, and he stood in there dishing out and taking the punishment the game mandates. Which brings me to the second truth about that experience. I made the right choice. Football requires _full_ commitment. Anything less and there's a genuine risk of getting seriously injured. I stood on the sideline watching the all star game unfold, and on the final play of the first half, I witnessed an act of committment that cemented my knowledge that the decision to wimp out was the right one. 

It was a simple pitch to the left. We were on defense, and playing well up to this point, but somehow we allowed the running back to get the corner. I watched from the sideline as the play developed, and by the time he turned all the way upfield, he had two lead blockers ahead and our whole defense behind him. Our whole defense, except one. 

Our free safety was always quiet in practice. Shy, almost. He wasn't withdrawn, but he didn't have the same cocky air about him as the others. But he was also one of the shavers. The top of my head came up to his Adam's apple. We all watched as he set off in pursuit and took an angle that put him out in front of the trio steaming forward. When he arrived, it happened. It only took a moment but in my memory it always plays in slow motion. He matched their speed for three steps, planted his foot and lowered his left shoulder. The timing caught the lead blocker off guard, but the force made that a moot point. Three deafaning pad cracks later, the play was over. All four players were picking themselves up while the sideline went nuts.

Though they couldn't legally buy cigarettes, go to war, or vote, these were men. I gazed up at them not like peers but like the grizzled uncles who swear in front of the kids. I don't remember a single other play from the all star game. Their irrelevance soars when contrasted against the raw evidence of the one play that proved what my gut and heart knew but I couldn't articulate: I didn't belong in football. Feeling secure in this knowledge, however, was not enough to quell the regret I felt over how often I stayed down after getting hit. This was a different kind of cowardice I vowed never to repeat. When I picked up ice hockey in high school, I established my principle. I drew my line. Never was the word I used, and I repeated it as often as I laced up my skates. Never again will I stay down, no matter how much it hurts. If I'm conscious, I'm getting up. This mantra came in handy. Every time I admired a pass too long or got caught with my head down, my first thought, often before the second wave of pain arrived, was "Don't forget to get up. You promised".

When it comes to principle, "never" and "always" are the most important parts. _Mostly_ principled is indistinguishable from _un_principled, which is the same brand of claptrap as telling others to do the right thing while we do the opposite.

So despite my rut, be it seasonal, caused by distractions from other projects, or based on the whims of the lunar tides, I'm still holding the Ace. The principle born out of the bad habit I'm burning off like dead wood. The preceding was an exercise in sticking to it, and though I'd like to divulge what it is, I'm afraid I can't. It's against my principles.

<!-- Next: describe the play, the two downfield blockers, and the raw aggression that saw our player roll through the blockers and bring down the ball carrier as time in the first half expired. -->

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
