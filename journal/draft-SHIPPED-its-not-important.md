How do we know what's important? When we picked out our last house, we took one look at the chandellier over the stairs and said "that's what we'll change first." That was in 2012, 9 years before we would move out of that house without so much as looking at one(1) chandellier on Amazon. We moved away from Florida and came back up to the northeast where I grew up. As we were driving from house to house with the realtor, I mentioned how excited I was to be able to play pond hockey again like I had when I was a kid. Without a hint of hesitation, she said, "Oh the ponds don't freeze here, so there won't be any hockey." Something I considered a key part of my new life up north was shattered. I believed it was important to me, but today is the first time I've thought about it since she said it. As it turns out, it wasn't important at all.

I think we can sum up our lives as a grand charade of pretending things are important. This is normal. And it's fine. We don't know we're pretending until reality and our behavior hands us the receipts. If we pay attention we can hone our ability to imagine how things might play out and our barometer for what matters gets more accurate. The only problem is other people will forever be in various stages of this process, and trying to convince someone that something they think is important _isn't_ is a dangerous game. Another pitfall, though I've never encountered this one, is the possibility that you neglect something of profound import, like remembering your wife's birthday or getting that colonoscopy. If that happens, though, I suspect more is wrong with you than the inability to understand the meaning of the word necessary.

Back when I started high school, my interest in drawing accelerated. Through the process of learning how to draw faces, a series of synapses in my brain went rogue and I became obsessed with female noses. I was always worried I'd meet the perfect girl (none exist) but she would have the wrong nose, whatever that meant, and I would have to choose between loneliness or giving up on my dream of dating the nostril queen of New Jersey (also not a thing). These are the ravings of someone who has zero grasp on the real world and the matters of true significance therein. I learned over time that having a certain nose would be the least of my concerns when it came to a relationship. For starters, having a pulse became more than enough after I learned girls don't simply knock on your door and introduce themselves twice a week. And for the record, my wife's nose is beautiful, but it wasn't even on the list of criteria when we started dating. The true important traits like "would make a good mother" and "laughs at my dumb jokes" rose to the top of the leaderboard where they remain to this day.

Time and age have a habit of squeezing the

I've been thinking a lot lately about what's next. I use the term lately loosely because I've been thinking a lot about what's next for a few years. But the exercise always leaves me unsatisfied, like a carousel ride that isn't quite long enough. I always end up back in the same place, accomplishing nothing more than a scattered series of daydreams about unfocused open-ended questions. I've read about a popular strategy in the workforce of leaving ones current job for a better one as soon as possible. The story goes, as soon as you get a new job you start looking for the next new job, each one paying better than the last so you can level up your salary 4x faster than you would waiting for annual increases at the same job. If your only goal is to make more money, I can see the logic. But what I value in my career has never been exclusive to money. What I value much more is autonomy and...what? Everyone wants autonomy. Once an acceptable financial bar is cleared, autonomy is the trait most coveted in a job. But I have autonomy. So why am I thinking about what's next? What about now is falling short of my expectations? It's how we work. On my own, I can find the energy. In a small group, let's call it one or two more people, I can find the energy. But depending on the personnel, the way we work and talk about the work is de-energizing. When done right, collaboration adds clarity and energy. When we collaborate, however, we say many words and spend many hours in meetings with no movement towards either. We have too many people not doing any things that will help anyone who pays for our software. That's my statement. We have too many people not doing any things that will help anyone who pays for our software. Where are our incentives? To capture new markets? To penetrate new industries? To find the next round of funding? I could ask these questions but since the way we talk about our work obfuscates the evidence instead of clarifying it, I'll never get an answer I could explain to someone else. An example of a clear answer is as follow: "In going after ___ market, we can look like we're a leader in that space (gross use of the word space) and new investors will be more likely to pony up for the chance to make a profit on our growth." In theory, though it doesn't align with what I think is important, I could get on board with that as a concept. At least it's honest about what we're trying to do with the business. Except, I don't really want to get on board with that. I would rather we build the best software we can, period. We're not doing that. But we SAY we're doing that. I guess that's where my wanderlust originates. 

As far as I can tell, the entire sales and marketing apparatus operates on a plane misaligned with any reality I can identify. Granted, I don't really know what goes on over there because I don't really want to know. On one hand, they're all working hard, probably much harder than me. On the other hand, I don't believe they have the customer's best interest in mind. Excuse me, did I just say salespeople aren't in it for the customers to get rich? Impossible, right? Let's start with marketing, then. 

This is a stupid screed. I have a kindergarted-level understanding of how this corporation operates, now more than ever. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

- If the character's motivated actions aren't objectionable, they probably aren't a good villain, and will chafe in the role. Likewise for heroes. -Devon Eriksen (https://x.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1858925691506491482)
- Story trumps all - a good story can elevate bad writing, but not the other way around.
- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action (ABDCE: Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending - Alice Adams, via Anne Lamott)
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
- Extremeness or Universal Truth, create that which will be remembered.
- Finally, why do you want to tell this story? You better be able to answer this. This is your theme. (Answer: To make people laugh while making them think.)
