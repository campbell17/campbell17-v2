Like 96% of the American population, I have a television in my house. Normally, a TV is arranged so the screen faces into the room, pointed toward comfortable seating to maximize its potential to entertain and delight. The other day, however, I walked into the living room and saw this.

I waited patiently for the flood of emotions to overwhelm me. The shock of undermined expectations, seeing the TV slumped pathetically on the floor like it was black-out drunk instead of hanging on the wall-mount I installed 2 years ago. The anger that I'd be euthanizing my morning plans to deal with this. The regret that I knowingly took a shortcut when I installed the mount.

But nothing happened. I paused and waited for an extra moment for a rise in blood pressure that never came. I can think of only three explanations for this:

1. It was _so_ unexpected, my brain had no choice but to skip the grief and begin assessing how to fix the problem.
2. The trauma of the event happened while I was out of the room. I didn't hear any loud noises and everyone else was out of the house at school or running errands. When I arrived on scene, the dust had already settled, leaving me to summon my inner CSI agent. 
3. I am an ant.

I mean, I can't rule that last one out, right? Look at the facts: I'm a team player. I have a powerful mandible. And apparently when someone kicks over my hill, or in this case my TV falls on the floor, I immediately set to fixing it without shedding a single tear over what just happened. Sorry, it's ironclad. I'm an ant.

One thing ants don't waste time on is examining _why_ their hill got kicked over, and again we're in alignment. Although in my case, it was my own carelessness that led to the fall, so I didn't _need_ to ask why because I already knew. For when we toured this house before buying it in the summer of 2021, I noticed the opening for the television in the built-in shelves would not accommodate our way-too-girthy-because-we-got-a-great-deal-on-black-friday flat screen. No problem. "I'll just buy a wall-mount," I told my wife, "so the TV extends past the opening, hovering amongst the outer shelves." But the day to install the mount arrived and I discovered a vertical piece of wood at the back of the opening against the wall, preventing me from centering the mount and utilizing the studs as the anchor points for the bolts.

At this point, a wiser man would cut a slot in the vertical piece and slide the mount through, removing all risk from the job by doing it properly. But I was in an empty house with hundreds of boxes to unpack and no earthly way to achieve that. So I spit in the face of good judgement, measured out the mounting spot, kissed the lag bolts up to God, and screwed them into the quarter-inch wood paneling I foolishly hoped would hold it. 582 days later, I ruminated on that decision as I left the tv sitting on the floor and went to the hardware store for additional lag bolts.

As I arrive back home, extra bolts in hand, I relish the opportunity to get everything back to normal as quickly as possible. I have tools now, and I even know where some of them are. A few months ago, my dad bequeathed me a utility saw he bought years ago but never used, and cutting a slot in this pesky vertical board is the type of job for which this saw is ideally suited. Measure once, cut twice (no one will see that jaggy cut behind the tv anyway), slide the mount into position, _this time aligned with the studs_, drive eight lag bolts through the mounting holes, and Bob's yer uncle. This mount will now hold a small horse if necessary. Time from disaster discovery to "like it never happened": One hour, forty-one minutes. Time spent freaking out: none.

Freaking out is not a generous activity. It doesn't give anything, it only takes. It takes time away from fixing the problem. It takes away the ability to use good judgement. It also takes years off my life if it's my default response to the unexpected. Ants don't have years to waste, so when it comes to crises we have no choice but to work the problem without the panic. Problems are already bad enough without taking on a Pavlovian response of unavoidable emotional anguish. Humans are lucky in that many of our perceived catastrophes are not life or death. Evolution honed our brains to fall back to fight or flight because that wasn't always the case, but in our cushy modern times we have a third option: "it's alright." Practicing an it's-alright mindset give me permission to skip over the FUD[1] associated with the unexpected and delve instead into how to effectively address and remediate the dilemma. But I'm not special. Everyone can do this. And the more I do it, the easier it is to repeat. Every predicament is an opportunity to pen an entry in my "it's alright" logbook, and the next time a problem comes my way, I'll remember that sometimes all I have to do is spend $3 on some more bolts. 

[1] Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt




Notes for next time: Relate that under 2 hours is minus the time I would have spent freaking out about it. Talk about how emotional control led to a clear mind and plan of action? Talk about how being an ant in these situations can shortcut unnecessary anguish and unlike my mounting shortcut, these hold up to the test of time.

NOTES: talk briefly about proper mounting, juxtaposed against my short-sighted decision, bringing the story back to me standing there staring at a tv on my floor.

Flash back to the spring of the year of our lord, 2021, and my family was staging for relocation. 

NOTES FOR NEXT TIME: talk about finding the house, seeing that the TV was too big for the opening, and picking out the mount that would allow it to suspend in front of the opening. Then talk about the discovery of the panel blocking it's proper mounting technique. Then talk about the lack of a tool to modify the panel. Then talk about the decision to utilize good-enough economics amidst the 1000 other things that still had to get done in a newly moved-into house. and so on...

- I unplugged the three remaining cables and slid the TV to the side, resting it gently against the couch. Damage unknown. But the fix is already happening in my mind.

- Maybe I felt nothing because I expected this was a possibility when I took a shortcut installing the mount.
- Funny thing about taking shortcuts, there's always time to do it right the second time.
- So I got to fixing it.
- BUT, I can't. Yet. Why wasn't this done correctly in the first place? I'm blocked by a plywood upright.
- A few months back, I took a weekend to visit my parents and build a spice rack with my dad. 
- We're close, and we're creative, but amazingly, we'd never done a project like this.
- My dad, generous as always, gave me an unused utility saw. He bought it and never used it and figured I'd be more likely to give it a hot supper.
- Now, as I stare at the empty expanse where my TV used to be, I know what stopped me from doing it right the first time. No utility saw.
- Find the studs. Done. Cut the hole. Done. Replace the mount properly. Well...
- Pre drilling needed. 2 benefits: 1, give the lag bolts a path into the stud so they don't wander. 2, test the "stud" to make sure it's really a stud. 
- 1st bolt doesn't go all the way in. Something harder than wood is preventing it from going all the way in, but it does go in about 2 inches out of the 4.
- Gotta go to Ace. Need 6 bolts.

- END in MIND: Emotion is a choice. Practicing choices makes them habits. Emotional control and mental toughness go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other. And drilling in until you find something you could do differently next time puts you in the driver's seat. 
- Ants choices are based on survival. While mine may not be life or death, they keep me from falling apart when all I needed to do was spend $3 on some more bolts.

Notes for next time: Add more buts and therefores, read below and try to meet the criteria wherever possible.

I’ve spent 1000s of hours studying the top storytellers in the world.

People like Tolkien, Rowling and Gaiman.

Here’s what I learned:

***

"What happens next?"

Neil Gaiman says you can sum up great storytelling with those 3 words.

They should be the first thing a reader (or listener) says if the story is stopped at any point.

***

Start with the end in mind

What do you want the outcome of your story to be?

• Reader falling in love with a character
• Customer buying a product
• Friend laughing hilariously
• Investor giving you money

If you start with the end in mind, the intro and middle naturally funnel to that target.

***

Shape your story

Humans gravitate to structure. Luckily there are tons to wrap around your story:

• Hero’s Journey
• StoryBrand
• Three Act

The goal of a story structure is to let the characters shine through.

The attached image is the actual plot outline JK Rowling created for the 5th Harry Potter.

***

Lead with action

Most people amble on in backstory for 10 minutes.

This is a waste of time.

Find the interesting parts of your story, jump right to it, and provide as little backstory as possible.

***

“But, therefore”

The creators of South Park use a simple heuristic.

If the word “And” fits into the transitions in your story, it’s probably boring.

Aim to use more “But” or “Therefore.”

They imply conflict, change, and tension.

***

Build a world

Tolkien said: 

“The story maker proves a successful sub-creator. They make a secondary world which your mind can enter.”

A few tips to create your world:

• Use rituals
• Define its laws
• Create shared language (you don’t need to create a brand new language like Tolkien did!)

Think about all the words you learned from the Harry Potter world: muggle, the spells, dementor, and many more.

Storytelling is how you introduce people to the world you’ve built.

***

Slow down

Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in.

When speaking, stop talking for 3 seconds.

When writing, make your paragraphs longer, add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.

Force your audience to hang on to every word.

***

Build to one moment

The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment.

But what is the moment about?

Change — I once was this, but now I’m this.

***

Develop your own creative process

JK Rowling uses outlines. Stephen King doesn’t.

Neil Gaiman writes every day. George RR Martin doesn’t.

Brandon Sanderson writes best at 11pm. William Faulkner at 9am.

The lesson? Do you, but be consistent.
