I saw a kid on a quad. We were driving back from the car dealership where I'd just plunked down the modicum of cash we saved up to buy my newly-licensed daughter a cheap-but-passable fist car. But that milestone was immediately overshadowed the moment I saw this kid. No helmet. Going full chat on a dirty grass trail about 40 yards from the edge of the road. That's the most freedom I've ever witnessed first-hand. Just a kid on a quad. 

It reminds me of one summer when I visited a friend from out of town. During my visit, we all took a day trip to his Uncle-or-someone's a couple hours away. I don't remember whose house it was, but they were having a party and the place was full. Their yard sloped downhill from the sides, down to a flat area with a beach volleyball court for some reason. This was rural Pennsylvania...or maybe it was West Virginia. To be honest, I'm pretty hazy on every detail but one: They had a quad. And they let us ride it.

This was my first time riding an ATV, so our first time around we rode tandem. I was in the back and my friend drove. It was a small quad, so there wasn't much room. I didn't know what to do when I first got on, so I just kinda sat there until my friend tore away across the beach leaving me suspended in mid air behind him like Wile E. Coyote. I hustled forward to get back on and when once the laughter subsided, we tried again. This time I clasped my arms around my friend so I had someone to drag down with me if I fell again. Once we got comfortable with the controls, we took turns. For what seemed like hours we did counter-clockwise laps, up the hill, across the front yard, down the other side, and across the court, ducking under the net as we raced through.

But I'm a man now, chugging along with the abundance of manly responsibilities as my caboose. So I don't many laps in quads these days. Because with each passing year from adolescence to adulthood, I traded away a morsel of the naive, the selfish, and the indulgent for the aware, the considerate, the moderate, and a third-round draft pick. And unfortunately, that draft pick shows up to training camp with nothing but a dry sponge, poised to soak up all my childlike wonder. But this is what is supposed to happen. We can't have both, and we certainly shouldn't remain naive and capricious. The scales of life are calibrated to punish the practice of selfish excess with endlessly diminishing returns. Sipping cervezas on the beach is fantastic until week two when, with peeling shoulders and sand up our cracks, we glance up from our romance novel and ask ourselves, "shouldn't I be doing something?" 

But when I saw that boy rumbling along on his quad I realized how trivial it is to fall prey to the other extreme, ending up as one of Thoreau's "mass of men leading lives of quiet desperation". So we have to remember to occasionally reach out for these moments like catching a firefly. We hunch over one at dusk, squinting to isolate it against the scenery. It's just dark enough to make us wait until it flashes one more time so we can track it long enough to cup our hands around it. We stand up straight and take a moment to watch it pace around, no doubt wondering why it landed involuntarily. We hope it lights up one more time before it squats, opens it's wings and takes off. And then the show's over.

Time to get back to work.








Seeing that kid reminded me that it doesn't all have to be one or the other. <-- the worst sentence of all time, make it better. Balance is the key to avoiding Thoreau's "life of quiet desperation". 

Notes: I think the above sentence is the start of my ending. 

<!-- This might be too indulgent. Maybe just use the second part? -->
We peek through our palms with anticipation, waiting for them to illuminate their temporary rest stop. Then we hold our hands out and present them back to the world, watching them flash once more as they take off.

Thoreau wrote about men leading lives of quiet desperation. 

When we saw that kid <- weak, plz fix, 

Notes: This is heading in a direction akin to: "life was grand once, now it's deperate, but at least for a day it got to be grand." I'm not sure I want that. I want to celebrate that kid and what he represents. He captured my soul as he captured my attention, and I had Steve with me to witness it. We both knew no one in the world was as happy or free as that kid at that moment. But too much of that isn't the aim. The scales of life are calibrated to punish the practice of excess with endlessly diminishing returns. So we reach out for these moments like catching a firefly, clumsily tracking them in the half-dark until they flash one more time and we can cup our hands over them. We peek through our palms with anticipation, waiting for them to illuminate their temporary rest stop. Then we hold our hands out and present them back to the world, watching them flash once more as they take off.



More Notes: Connect this last part with living a balanced life - never stop reaching but always remember to let go. Finding the quad moments amongst the quiet desperation Thoreau described. 

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things..”
― Henry David Thoreau, Civil Disobedience and Other Essays

But I'll always remember the summer I got to be the kid on the quad.


Notes? Who knows man. Keep going. 

DO NOT "ACT". THIS IS NOT LINKEDIN.

Global Notes:

Let's have some fun. "Caution rarely leads to awesome." (- John August, Inneresting 05/18/23)

- Start with the end in mind: What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
- Lead with action
- “But, therefore”
- Promise, Progress, Payoff
- Before your story’s climax, pause to force your audience to lean in. Add more sensory details, and layer on the drama.
- The entire story should be designed to amplify one moment. (Van Neistat in "Details" is simply swapping the logo on the grill of his Toyota, but the video is gripping because of the structured buildup)
- What did we learn?
- Do you, but be consistent.
