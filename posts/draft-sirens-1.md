For the first time since college, I'm making art that goes beyond a simple hour-long sketch. As I settle into my [new routine](/post/new-morning-routine/), the potential for larger ideas begins to emerge amongst these fun, but mostly one-off daily drawings. First up is a series of portraits for 2021 entitled "Sirens".

As an addendum to the Series itself, I'm documenting what I learn along the way in the form of post-mortem essays. You're currently reading the first. I have no earthly idea where any of this will end up, but I'm confident the upward movement will be _more than zero_, which seems like a good place to start.

### The Tools

This is less of a how-to and more of a general documentation of what I'm learning as I progress, but for the purposes of being thorough, let's go over some tools & materials.

#### Paper

For sketching and informal exploration, I use Strathmore Toned Gray sketchbook. I like having the ability to add highlights with white charcoal or colored pencil without having to fill in the midtones manually.

I use gessoed illustration board for the acrylic studies and X-PressIt 8x10 blending card when I switch to Copic markers / inks.

#### Graphite

I've bounced around between standard wood pencils, .5mm mechanical pencils, and others, but I always seem to return to the classic red Koh-I-Noor Technigraph 5611 lead holders. I love how weighty they are and I recently got a [desk-mounted sharpener](https://ebay.to/2Z9gawb) which lets me keep one hand free. (That sharpener was pretty hard to track down, so I linked to the same ebay listing where I got mine)

I have 3 of these lead holders, each with a different softness so I don't have to waste time manually swapping out from stage to stage. 

* For initial layout and composition I use a 2H, which allows me to be really loose without worrying about rogue marks, since those will all but disappear when I move on to HB. 

* The HB then reinforces the shapes and form of the drawing, allowing the superfluous marks to recede. 

* Finally, I subtly attack with something softer like a 2B to give the darks more life and add to the overall contrast and line quality. The softness of this pencil varies since I can achieve similar results as long as it's softer (thus, darker) than HB.

On toned paper, the final step is to add the lighter values and some spot highlights either with a white Prismacolor pencil or a white charcoal pencil.

#### Ink / Brushes

For the initial inking stage, I use a .35mm Copic multiliner, switching to the .7mm when I want to start varying the line weight. For larger areas I use a round brush that has a bright feel (snappy as opposed to limp) and comes to a nice point.

#### Color

I use Copic markers, india ink, and acrylic paints at various points in the process since they all play relatively well together. I rarely use watercolor or oils when I'm mixing media, but that's down to a comfort level more than anything else. I have limited Copic colors at the moment (xxxx, xxxx, xxxx, xxxx, and xxxx.), so they acted mostly as a basis for the skin tones. The acrylics I use are Liquitex titanium white, raw umber, cadmium yellow medium, ultramarine blue, prussian blue, and cadmium red medium. For inks, Black Magic india ink and red india ink.

### The First Sketch

The original idea for the series appeared as I warmed up for one of my daily drawings. I wasn't looking for a series to work on - nor was I thinking ahead about where I might take my art in 2021 - but a little voice told me to keep exploring so I drew a few variations to round out the initial pose ideas and hey presto, I have something cool to work on for the foreseeable future.

### The First Drawing

With the initial pose sketched out, I shot some reference and got to work on the first drawing. In retrosepct, this is my favorite part of Sirens I, which is probably not a good thing. I sometimes get attached to an early study and struggle to replicate its essense in subsequent studies, and that absolutely happened here.

### Studies

I'm guilty of wanting to jump to the final piece too early. Knowing this, I forced myself to slow down and take the time to meander a bit with different mediums, processes, and styles. For my first study, I import the drawing into Procreate and try doing some digital painting with the Apple Pencil on an iPad. I have extensive experience _designing_ digitally but I rarely paint that way, so I struggle a bit with the tools. After grinding through a few tepid color studies, I abandon the iPad and move on.

The first of three acrylic studies is an attempt to harness a painting technique that more closely matches my drawing style which is somewhat sketchy and imprecise at times. I use a small flat brush with very short bristles and it seems to work pretty well. The study is small and mostly for brush stroke practice, though I do attempt to achieve some decent skin tones. I'm happy with the result, so I decide to move up in size and see how these small brush strokes work as the piece gets bigger.

The second study exposes the issue I most often run into when I paint: I can't get out of the first stage. I block everything in just fine, but when I have to add more detail and do a better job of describing the form, my brain locks up and I basically just keep repainting the first layer without knowing how to proceed. If I had to guess, I'd say this is a simple case of not painting enough to get my comfort level up to par. If I spent hundred of hours painting and still couldn't come to grips with this issue, I'd probably start to worry, but until then, I'll keep practicing. The more time I spend trying things out, the less worried I'll be of taking the risks necessary to grow. When I relize I'm doing it again with the second study, I push a little further but eventually bring in some colored pencils to rescue me (*feels shame).

To use colored pencils as a lifeline feels like a step in the wrong direction since I'm not going to learn anything new by doing it. However, here's some possible insight into why I did this:

**Comparison of before / after colored pencils on my Moleskine study

In this sketchbook portrait, just a few strokes of Prismacolors applied to an acrylic base completely transforms it, so I assume the same will occur with study 2. I'm half right, but I think the larger size means the colored pencil has a diminished impact on the overall look, and the mistakes and crimes of the tentative underpainting are too much to cover up.

Study number 3 was more of the same and actually introduced some critical drawing mistakes which completely undermined the purpose of the study. I spent more time wondering why the pose was stiff and the proportions were off than practicing my painting technique, a.k.a. the whole point of the study. I trudged through, citing the desire to press on even when things aren't working, but ultimately this study was doomed from the start. I shifted gears and decided to revert back to something that I felt more comfortable with. In hindsight, this was cowardly, but I think at the time I felt like it had already taken too long up to that point and I just wanted to get any version of Sirens 1 in the books so I could move on.

### Sirens 1 "Final" (Study 4)

In an act of surrender, I plucked a fresh sheet of Xpress It Copic paper and prepared to draw Sirens 1 again, this time with the intent of finishing it with ink / Copics. At this point, I know this isn't going to pass for a true "final" piece, but I see myself coming back to it at the end of the series and applying what I learned to bring it up to the same level as the others. With that in mind, I was able to be less precious with the likeness in the drawing and focus more on capturing the gesture, which would hopefully reduce some of the stiffness I inadvertantly introduced in the prior studies.

I lightly laid in the drawing, paying attention to the areas I wanted to improve, then switched to inks. I struggle keeping my hand steady enough to use a brush, so I use a fine Copic multiliner and allow myself to be a little scratchy, knowing I'll be going over those lines with a thicker pen and adding more lineweight gradually. I'd like to get to a place where I have more mastery of the brush so I can smoothly and gracefully ink something up, but I think my spazzy nature will make that an uphill battle. I won't say it'll _never_ happen, but I have my doubts.

Because I don't use a brush, I have to achieve line-weight contrast by going over certain areas more thoroughly with the pen. It's not ideal and not as clean and pure as doing it "the right way", but if I didn't tell anyone about it they probably wouldn't notice. (show closeup)

Once I felt pretty good about the overall line quality, I went in with a brush to lay in some of the larger areas where accuracy wasn't as critical. I continued to add detail, began adding skin tones, and I started thinking about what to do for the background. Note: it's usually a good idea to consider something as significant as the background _before_ you arrive at the 4th study, but being the first in a series, this piece is where most of the dumb mistakes will be made (I hope).

As I was adding the skin tones, it became clear that I had no clear path forward regarding the petals. I always assumed they would stay white and I could add in some subtle tones to add depth, but something about the way the ink looked persuaded me to try something else. I glanced over at the bottle of India ink on my desk, reached for a brush, and before I could talk myself out of it I was slathering on large strokes of black ink. I didn't want to allow myself to be tentative with anything, so a rash change like this was ok. It completely changed the mood of the subject and gave me a confidence boost even though the aesthetic wasn't particularly beautiful. 

Now I shifted my focus to completing the background. In addition to my small set of Copic markers, I have an off-brand set of alcohol-based markers that I don't use very often since the colors are too saturated for most things. However, since my Copic set is limited to mostly skin tones, this was a good opportunity to lay down some large areas of these seldom used colors as a base for the background. I decided to start simple with a blue for a sky area and a straw yellow for some ground. As expected, the colors were a bit too bright and I decided to lean into the sky idea and add some acrylics to desaturate the blue. I used a medium sized round brush that has a lot of spring in its bristles, which suits the way I address the paper. I was pleasantly surprised at the results and I went further, adding clouds and a little more gradient. I didn't mind the color of the ground as much, but it needed some color variety and texture so I again called upon some acrylics to attend to that.

With the background having more detail and texture, the original skin tones in the face became a bit pale and flat, so I went back in with more reckless abandon and pushed the areas of color further, adding more contrast and saturation where needed. I also went back in with the inks and added more texture to the hair and linework to the face so it more closely matched the look and feel of the rest of the piece.

I enjoyed the experimental aspect of working through Sirens 1, but I have some takeaways that will hopefully facilitate a higher level of quality in subsequent pieces:

1. Take more time on the drawing, but iterate more quickly through the studies

2. Consider everything in the initial drawing, i.e. don't put off thinking about the background, cropping, etc

3. Shoot more reference
